almost 49 and the chasm of emptiness has never been greater ive been diagnosed severe bi polar where you no longer even get the good manias they just manifest as agitation or rage after 32 years of fighting this shit i know there can be only one end ive tried everything except dmt or psychedelics but why would that help unless you can live in that realm for a majority of the time ive always known it would never get better because there is just no way to overcome that the roi on life is an investment no one would ever make it given the choice,1

screen time negatives i feel like these screens are more harmful than we realize as weve turned to them during this global lockdown for a way to connect to people safely i feel another trend has arisen and thats the negative effects that these screens have on our interactions demand people expect you to be available at the drop of a hat because they know youre currently glued to your phone hyperbole aside i make sure my phone migrates from room to room with me for work for emergencies it doesnt stray from my side that doesnt mean i owe anyone an immediate answer distance you can type things you wouldnt dare say out loud like what i just typed about not owing anyone an immediate response because you cant see the persons face you are less in tune with their reaction and therefore less concerned about the effect your words will have curating interactions because its not instant you have time to craft your response that means the exchange of texts or emails when it resembles a conversation is a highly curated interaction in which each participant can choose how long they take to perfect their response while this should promote clarity in that you can take your time to gather information and respond it actually means people have time to manipulate answers intentional on read there can be an effect to silence sometimes silence speaks think about a pregnant pause in natural conversation that lets you know someone is thinking when we can use the screens between us to ignore someone to be silent sometimes thats louder than outright hostility concluding my list as i write this at 00 38 i was up having these thoughts and letting them run their course hoping they would serve the same purpose as counting sheep no luck the contemplation woke me up and for fear of losing my train of thought i immediately reached for my phone now ive extended this late night indefinitely as i labor over this post and begin yet another highly curated interaction between strangers using screens whos with me nerdface,0
i just realized that i believe that if im not constantly under a lot of pressure i wont perform well in pretty much every aspect of my life it doesnt matter what im doing i always find a way to psyche myself out its pretty exhausting and i want to stop i feel like in a way i have an addiction to it,1

i 16m might be clinically depressed i 16m dont understand if i am just feeling extremely anxious or am i depressed its not like i am getting suicidal thoughts or something i am just not feeling okay i have no idea how to describe it but i am getting that feeling in my gutchest you know the one you get when you receive some upsetting news it has been fairly constant throughout the past 12 months i read that depressed people do not experience emotions but i am experiencing them but if i am left alone i go back to being anxious or upset i have kept myself busy for the past one month by studying youtube reddit anything i do not want to see a psychiatrist nor do i want to talk to my parents about it they both are mds but i think they wont understand i do not want to share my problems with them and put just another burden on them also i think i can pinpoint the cause of this depression i just want to know if these were the symptoms anyone has experienced when they were depressed,1
losing streak i feel like im really close to the end of my rope i cant remember the last time ive caught a break its just been shitty news followed by more shitty news things dont get better but sometimes after a few days of wallowing ill feel just a shred of tranquility in my life just for it to get yanked out from under me at this stage even the littlest things just throw me off the edge and ill spiral back into all these dark thoughts i just feel like im broken and i dont belong in this world idk i just want this pain to end,1

am i not in control does anybody else get this feeling from stress like youre not in control of your own body in any way like you cant think critically or sometimes at all your motions are like jelly and even when you get control youre super uncoordinated or a clumsy in social situations you feel more like a passenger for your own body who has no idea what to say or do but still has the capacity to be angry at yourself for not saying anything or doing something its like this selfawareness that stops short of allowing me to do anything i have a lot of stressors in my life and i cant help but think theyve burnt me out so much so that ive become subject to these things ive been told before to prioritize or to take on less things as a solution but to me thats synonymous with settling on being capable of less than i thought im capable of how do people function with high stress how do you groom yourself to do that ive lived like this for so many years and thought it would just come with experience but now it just feel harder than its ever been,1
staying busy to stay out of my own head stressed and overwhelmed just dont cover what im feeling i have immersed myself into my career at the company i have been working with for 5 years this march i am in my mid 20s and in a position that everyone said i couldnt do when i was promoted the first 3 months were rough but i learned from my mistakes and got comfortable and do my job well the first year and a half in management i was always stressed but i was not as overwhelmed as i am now and i seemed to enjoy myself outside of work more i got to a point around the 2 year mark in management where i was super comfortable where i was and was working regular hours 45 hours a week or so when coronavirus hit it was like our workflow increased with less people to work and more demand on us as managers i went through one of the hardest summers working with minimal help doing more projects then ever follow this by hurricane sally worked 60 hours for a few weeks customers constantly not being understanding of the situation and only making me feel like i was failing them to no fault of my own the next few months my workload seemed to grow exponentially but i was unable to focus and keep up with where i know i need to be i eventually go to the doctor and test for adhd and get prescribed adderall i should add i was already taking adderall at times for a month or two prior because i could not focus at work whatsoever the adderall helped me more then i couldve hoped i was now as high functioning as i used to be and was knocking work out it has leveled out some now and i feel normal on it now but still get positive results out of it now i am in the same boat as last spring 40 of employees i need to keep up with workflow certain material is hard to come by or non existent constant weather issues and customers just keep approving work i am working almost always 7 days a week im up by 445 and wont get home until 5 or 6 on average but i have a few days every week i work till 7 or 8 to finish a job or get material i now even spent my money to setup an office at home so i could work in my free time just to try and catch up we are working skeleton crews and seems there is no end in sight to the labor shortage a lot of the responsibilities i feel so overwhelmed and stressed by are ones i have taken on myself because no one else was i have an ownership mentality and treat this business as it was my own now thats the work part of it i had an almost 5 year relationship with the girl i was in love with that ended in me heartbroken and afraid to trust any one i kept to myself but talked to a few women here and there i found one that i had any real connection with and that ended as a failed relationship i fell more in love with this woman then i ever felt with my previous girlfriend and was in a dark place when she left follow this by months of me feeling like i wasnt enough and no one i wanted wanted me i have a handful of good friends and a couple that are one of a kind but i always feel like i am bothering them or just there to be there but i know this is me overthinking and all that i also rented a house with my best friend that has turned into a nightmare cant say anything without him getting defensive no help around the yard or house constantly taking advantage of me being nice he was also working with me and turned into a bum and was missing work constantly and always so negative to be around so add all that stress at work and come home to a house you hate the other person there and have to dread being home until he moves out the past two months have been the hardest ive ever dealt with mentally and physically im working 1012 hours a day and coming home and putting proposals or schedules together i feel like i cant take a day off much less a whole weekend its like we are batting against the odds and something goes wrong every week but we are also doing great and revenue out the wazoo all while working salary and not being compensated for the overtime i feel like im about to explode every day i feel like im about to have a meltdown and crash mentally my mental health seems to have its days some are great some are just days and some days i just want to stop how can i cope with all this stress that i take on myself and cant leave at work,1

the thought of the minuscule chance of coming across my boyfriend on bumble two years ago makes me incredibly grateful to have him today i came across my boyfriend in 2019 on bumble not sure what my profile looked like or his or what it said but im happy we matched we went on a date and we were very similar however we were both busy and never set up a second date fast forward a year later he requested me randomly on instagram which we had never shared with each other i messaged him and the next week we were on a date it lasted like 8 hours and we just talked and talked and talked it was amazing since then weve been together moved in and are almost at a year we are like the same person and i could not be more grateful for him it may sound silly but i think of the very tiny chance of meeting him on the app or the tiny chance of coming across each other again and it makes me so much more grateful for him last year before we met again he had a plan to move back east after college this year he stayed in my state with me just feeling super blessed and i know sometimes dating apps arent great but sometimes you come across some great people,0

my worst enemy is myself when it comes to stress yes im stuck in a job i hate and i dont have the option of leaving at all but i am my own worst enemy here i constantly stress about the small things and its really affecting my capacity to perform the days feel like years and im always at the verge of breaking after one or two days please teach me methods to overcome this i tried reframing my perspective but in the moment i still stress,1
anyone else have semisuicidal thoughts on a regular basis im not saying gun to my head thoughts i mean like driving down the road and once in a while my brain says just turn into the opposite lane itll look like an accident but then i just shake it off or shaving my legs and think just cut bleed out its so easy but i never actually act on these things theyve just become a part of my life i feel like my depression is almost personified in a weird cloud that follows me around with bad intentions that i have to constantly argue with its exhausting,1
for the first time in 4 years i feel hopeful for what the future holds for me ive never really been hopeful for anything and if i have been its never lasted for more than an hour my expectations have always been at rock bottom to protect myself from disappointment this has worked well for me with minimal hurt from hoping too much but i dont need to do that anymore i dont necessarily know why but since june ive been looking forward to waking up every morning actually i know why its because the belief that i had to die to feel at peace has been proven wrong completely wrong its so reassuring to know it is possible to be happy and alive at the same time for the past few years ive been wallowing in my depression i feared death but at the same time craved it so as foolish as i was i tried failed and regretted backing out for about 8 months mainly because i was now on peoples watchlist i had a fear of pills for a while just the thought of them made my stomach twist and turn i would constantly lay in bed stay up late to wake up minutes before the bus i was convinced that there was nothing left for me so i acted impulsively if i was gonna go i was going to go out with a bang i fractured my hand had a scrap with my bastard of a parent attempted planned another but at the same time i desperately hung on i didnt really want to die no one really does a close friend of mine dragged me out i will always admire and appreciate her for having the patience to deal with me she let me stay and ive realized her family is the polar opposite of mine calm and quiet majority of the times full of fun laughter they dont raise hands or lace poison in their words i didnt know that this was possible for me to be happy for more than an hour for me to be a part of a household where my contribution is appreciated and needed where my mental illness is not a myth where my feelings dont have to be locked away i feel so validated and unconditionally loved i want to start getting professional help to better myself i feel like with this i can keep pushing forward that i will keep standing up after falling down no matter how many times that will be i dont know why but i feel happy to be here,1

my family is holding me back and making my life hell and its ruining my job and health a bit of background my sister struggles with mental illness to the extreme were talking cops at our door constant trips to the hospital alternate schooling and the whole lot she needs 247 supervision and we have to have everything locked away out of her reach at all times i currently live with both my mom and my sister and needless to say its very overwhelming dealing with her me and my mom have a hard time keeping it together and my mom will often turn on me due to stress and since i have no outlet it makes going to work near impossible because i just sit and get angry about whats going on at home now suddenly our landlord turned around and sold the house weve lived there for over 13 years been good tenants and always paid rent on time he gave us no written notice and has made our life a living hell its all super illegal but thats a completely different story we have 2 months to leave our original plan was to get a 3bdrm and split it but due to high housing prices we live in a big city and landlords are ridiculous here super scummy they try to charge for many illegal things even asking hundreds of dollars just to fill out and submit an application even then its not a guarantee and half the places are bug infested and in the centre of crackhead central ive suggested to her that she finds a cheap 2 bedroom in the city for the time being with my sister she needs to stay in the city or my sister loses all her support workers schooling and the lot its a 2 year waiting list minimum to get back in a program even if we provide transportation because the city will no longer cover it i drive and work fulltime i can go where ever i want my mother however doesnt drive and is currently laid off due to covid i dont want to deal with them anymore the constant violent out bursts the screaming and crying everyone at my work thinks im crazy because im always crying or throwing up from stress i had to go on stress leave before this because the physical effects from stress was making it impossible and dangerous to work the dizzyness and vomiting and the whole lot now when i suggested going our seperate ways to my mom i offered to help her in any way she would need including money and transportation to whatever extent i could spare it ended with her screaming and crying that i was abandoning her this makes me feel terrible but also makes me lean towards leaving even more what route do i take i know moneys already very tight for her and i love her but living like this day to day is literally killing me and i want to grow as a person and live my life tldr my family struggles with mental health and i have the option to leave for my own sanity but it means abandoning them in their time of need,1

i just realised today that i have paid off half of my credit card debt ive had this debt for nearly 3 years now and due to various financial situations it has been hard to clear it over the last 15 years though i have been slowly chipping away at it and steadily paying about 21 a month its not much but my financial situation hasnt been great today i have gone to pay my bill and discovered that i have actually paid half already plus my financial situation is only improving this year and hopefully i will soon be able to pay it off completely which then means i can start using it responsibly to get my credit score back up while i save and then be able to get a good rate for a mortgage in a few years time,0
how to get out of the habit of stressing hi everyone i have come to realise that my mind and body is defaulted towards being stressed from the minute i open my eyes to the minute i close them i am constantly doing things and feeling like i am a few steps behind so for me it seems like an ingrained habit that i sort of deault to constantly does anyone have any ideas on how to break the habit of stressfully doing things and balancing it with just being i do meditate yoga and those kinds of things but even that can sometimes be a stressful must any thoughts would be much appreciated,1
balance im struggling lately with managing my heart and mind working in harmony when presented with stress where im sure in my decisions with with a handful of my most recent stress inducing situations and how i handled them the discordance in others is stifling and im not sure how to handle things the upset causes my emotions to muddy my decisions and vice versa and stress seems to be a catalyst in all of it its taken its toll on me over time and im worried about damage its caused or is causing reaching out here to ask how others have found they best handle their own stress and stressful situations im trying to pick up more healthy methods of coping on my own thanks,1
depression feels more real optimism feels like a delusion throughout the day ill have moments sometimes hours even when things look up ill plan out ways to achieve all sorts of goals get my life together etc but all the while it just feels sort offake like im tricking myself im always wondering how long can i keep it up this time when the time comes that i finally admit its all pointless that my life will be terrible no matter what i try to do it always feels more like accepting reality than depression this is always reasserting my belief that any sort of medication or therapy that actually had any sort of positive effect none ever has would just be a delusion like cypher knowingly going back into the matrix to be able to eat steak it just seems like a dishonest existenceand then i tell myself id rather be sad in the real world then happy living a delusion i dont really know why im writing this here i guess im just sick of talking to myself this somehow seems a little better that might be another delusion,1
is it worth waiting to see if your life eventually ever gets better im about to turn 25 and i dont even want it this year the disingenuous attention is going to bum me out long story short i lost my job and then got stuck at my parents house my dad is very narcissistic and toxic and is often damaging to my mental health i spent this past year developing myself more learning more into my career reading books becoming spiritual and finding a cause to do good in the world i figured all of this is pointless i might as well spend it doing at least one thing thats bigger than me and then i can die happy i dont need to be famous i just wish i can move the needle positively in society or in a community in some way i dont know what that is yet but im learning a lot of marketing and i consider myself a creative and passionate individual i am a musician also i also volunteer and am involved but its all remote right now i dont have a real job i have no friends and now my band is falling apart last year no one showed up to my birthday gathering which is kind of what caused me to start this journey i can start a new band by myself and i can move out and find new friends that arent toxic and like me and respect me maybe even find a girlfriend i used to have at least a couple of those things at different points in my life ive been through 12 salary paying job interviews these past 2 months and none of them bite now i have nothing and i spent a year on myself for nothing i have friends family and my therapist keep telling me just wait your time will come and other similar pointless advice that gives you nothing tangible to work with and instead is just your life sucks you cant do anything about it just wait and see if it gets better well what if it doesnt what if i get hit by a car tomorrow god i really hope i do i mean im thankful that im healthy and alive under a house but i still pay exorbitant bills and its really not easy even with a garbage freelance job i dont want to live through this bullshit anymore its been a year i want my reparations back for all the people who lied to me for all this time am i being a freak or what why cant i just catch a fucking break edit you guys are really sweet and this made my day thank you,1
im breaking apart and no one gives a fuck i swear to god if i manage to kill myself and someone say some bullshit like if only she talked to us wed have helped im coming back as a ghost to make their life a living hell keep your problem to yourself and your therapist because everyone else will use them to hurt you,1
how i lived which eventually made me burned out get diagnosed with fatigue syndrome hey im doing some videos where i share my burnout fatigue syndrome journey in my latest i talk about how my life looked like prior to burning out shure it got more intense the last six months before hitting the wall but in reality it started ten years earlier when i started studied to get a masters degree in engineering in short i kept myself busy all the time i didnt particularly feel that stressed out i know the bad kind of stress which just cause a tremendous amount of anxiety and that wasnt very present but always being on and just putting in too many work hours per week without any real off mood i think is what eventually broke me if you want to watch the video its here,1
depression numbness question is it normal that i like sense a disconnection in my brain happening like i can actually feel some kind of weird numbness it also gets stronger when i get energy rushes or anxiety like yes its a numbness that numbs out chemical sensations u get from emotions and drive but like i can like feel it in my brain is that normal thx u,1
i cried for the first time in years the last time i cried before this was around 5 years ago when my dad passed away this was when i was 14 this time the reason is also a sad one but not related too someone passing away i think it was an accumulation of not feeling understood stress for my exams and the realisation that even if i talk to my mother the only living relative i still havelive with she cant understand what im feelinggoing through we talked for so long and literally 5 minutes later it looks like she forgot all we talked about and continued minimising everthing i said and felt afterwards i just walked away and the tears just came just had to get this out somewhere,1
stressed because of the possible longterm complications of stress i am under some i consider huge emotional work familyrelated stress right now and have been for at least the last couple years the situation is not likely to change in the next few months and i feel like i have already gotten so used to it but sometimes what stresses me out more is when i think about what could be possible longterm complications of the stress im having right now like everywhere you would read that stress death and all the diseases causedpromoted by stress like yeah i feel pretty stressed out but overall its still somehow bearable at the moment just because ive gotten so used to it but what if in a couple years when im finally ready to enjoy my life i get diagnosed with cancer or some other disease because of the shit i went through and yeah sometimes thinking about that stresses me out more than the actual stress im dealing with atm itself if that makes sense does anybody else feel like this,1

i am 58 m seems to be most subscribers are young just like the title says i am 58 m i visit rdepression every day and start by clicking new while reading the posts i am always looking for those in my age bracket which is few and far between my depression has its roots in 2001 but it really took hold during the financial collapse starting in 2008 when i first visited my therapist about 6 weeks ago i typed a one page summary of my life from 2001 to current it wasnt pretty went from a financially secure entrepreneur business owner great father decent husband community volunteer coach etc to lost house broke in debt irs issues depressed mother fer the issues were caused by me putting my head in the sand and not being proactive before i always took the initiative and created opportunity slowly but surely i lost that ability and piece by piece my world came crumbling down so my story is different than a young person facing depression as a sophomore in college or a 16 year old afraid to tell their parents about their depression i care about what they write because i have 2 children 30 25 and i hope they never experience what we are going through but i still read every new post because i hope to find the answer to my condition ok time to go and look at the pile of important things to do and decide if i am going to take the initiative or go into my typical depressive state have a good day,1

worst night yet long rant im 15 right now school is becoming so hard ive got to the point where im so stressed that i just spend all my time thinking about my work instead of actually doing it for the next 3 weeks ive got a big important test each day theyre not even exams just big tests i told myself that i would start studying yesterday i came home opened my agenda and started crying it was big ungly loud sobs im so stressed i basically had a mental breakdown over school and this isnt even the hardest year one of the only ways i deal w stress is cutting myself so that occupied me for a while people always say put ur mental health before school work but for me a lazy perfectionist that makes my mental health worse im so tired because by the time ive finished crying about how much work i have im completely drained and i fall asleep i then wake up when my parents come home so 8pm have dinner and then start my school work im usually still up at 12 am then i wake up at 7 and start again and my teachers then give us more fucking work cuz u know 1 mental breakdown a week isnt enough i cant fucking deal w this anymore but if i give up on school then ill be even more stressed if such a thing is possible,1
i dont even know why im depressed ive been in an endless cycle of momentary happiness and a deep hard drop for so long now i dont even know why im depressed anymore most of the things in my life that have kept me down i feel like ive made peace with i miss feeling happy like genuine happiness not where i suppress my sadness and force myself to be happy and put on a brave fave in front of everyone i had a girlfriend and whenever i tried to talk to her she told me it wasnt her problem and that she couldnt help me not in so many words but yeah now shes gone and im doing better cause i have some friends to talk to but that hasnt helped either i find myself falling again losing motivation again feeling like ending it all again ive contemplated suicide multiple times but i havent taken the leap just yet i dont know how much longer i can take this it seems like im only ever happy when i do drugs but i dont have the money for that and i already recovered from an addiction once and i cant fall into one again idk why im typing this but last time i posted on a subreddit typing out my feelings really helped i feel like me not knowing why im depressed makes me more depressed and it just keeps getting worse,1

dont have any comments if you can hope you are all doing well or if not that things get better for you 3 i know this post will be ignored but at least i tried at least i tried to get help from my parents friends school hotlines reddit but nobody wants to help the only person i had left was my bf but yesterday he just said he feels like all he is is a therapist to me it really broke my heart into a million pieces because i dont have anybody else to talk to and he always said it was okay for me to vent to him my parents called me a freak and a weirdo said that i need to snap out of this and get over myself after they saw my stupid blog about my depression when i was 13 idk why i made that 13 yr old me was questionable they got enraged when they saw my self harm at 14 they got really mad the tension in the house and the shame was unbearable i couldnt look at them in the eyes and spent most of my time hiding in my room now i act like im fine and happy all the time we talk about other stuff and joke and laugh together and its massively improved our relationship im grateful to have parents i now get along with but its only because i hide my mental health lately things have gotten so bad its getting hard for me to hide it from them im forgetting to do things they told me to im losing things they lent to me theyre getting pissed off when i didnt mean to im not doing this on purpose got mad because i didnt phone my grandma to thank her for some money of course it came across as rude and i felt so guilty my whole family probably thinks i dont care about them i feel like shit but they dont want to know the truth my friends they all have it bad bad home lives mental health problems every single one of them and im always trying to help them but when i tried to open up they treated it like a competion and didnt even ask what was up with me just said they had it worse i havent spoken to them in weeks because im so depressed and nobody even checks up on me to see how i am its hard to pretend im happy and smiling and laughing so i dont talk to them im not okay but theyre not in the right place to help me they need help themselves its getting really hard to socialise i talk to my boyfriend everyday and its just so so so hard to talk and do normal things with him i try to cover up how bad im hurting but sometimes i crack he said it was okay for me to vent anytime but it looks like i did it too much and he says he feels like a therapy buddy i feel so fucking shit that i cant even get my shit together school is so difficult i log onto my live lessons and sit there and listen to my tutor saying mental health matters guys when their school counsellor wont even bother to show up time and time again the school counsellor has cancelled on me last minute or during class when we cant use our phones or just simply not been there my mental health doesnt fucking matter to the school does it they say its really important we look after our wellbeing so they suggest going out for a walk breathing taking breaths and talking to someone well we already know thats not fucking possible but the other tips are just really basic level things they dont bother to invest deeper into mental health and help people with genuine problems because they might not have superhero parents that can get them to the doctors or therapists they only tell us how to look after our wellbeing when im doing all those things and its gone beyond that im really doing badly and they dont care they just expect you to get on with it so i get told off for not participating in my live lessons well im sorry that i tried to reach out for help because you said mental health matters and yet i got nothing so you now you expect me to act okay and surprise surprise i cant fucking do it i cant switch off my mental health for you school there is no place in school for people like me when they expect you to be motivated high achieving focused participating just always okay and i cant do it and i know this will transfer into the real world the working world they always expect you to be okay and its not like i want to walk around looking all miserable but its just getting so hard to keep that happy mask on all the time i have a university interview coming up soon i dont know if i can do it im so broken and suicidal that i dont think i can act all enthusiastic and persuade them id be a great passionate hardworking student when i can barely do my schoolwork and struggle to even get out of bed dress myself and eat theres so many signs im struggling and nobody cares if youre lucky they will say they do they spit out the cliches give you the useless suicide hotline number and move on with their lives in most circumstances you have to shut up and act like youre okay your whole life there is no place in the world for people like me,1
money games nonsense so i stress about the worst stuff things i shouldnt be stressed about i have recently spent 300 on a roleplaying game for deluxe cars and im now starting to regret it realising that i might not stay on that server for less than a year so im thinking to myself what was the point i just put 300 in the trash because since they are my only friends and they leave then i would be alone and wouldnt want to stay in that server and then i wouldnt be able to savor the cars that i spent 300 on im also stressing about the same server i only have 3 friends in that server some might leave in like a month or two some might leave in a year so i want to spend as much time with them as i can same thing for the 300 i spent i had to decide to get a job in game and wanted to be a police officer which i thought was really cool but in a previous situation the work of a police man in that server was really stressful which i realised from one annoying guy so i wanted to quit and be a prison guard which isnt that much of a fun job but i would be with my four friends who work together there my dad irl told me that i shouldnt quit something because of one annoying person since there are a lot of people who are going to be annoying in my life i stress about multiple other things but those are not what are stressing me that much now anymore i love this server and i want to continue playing on it i have vowed not to use that much money a game ever again which is already a start but what has been done is done and ive decided to work with my friends even if the job isnt that cool cause i want to spend time with them but i still cant stop stressing about all of it does anyone have any ways to not stress about things like this overall,1
labeled as mature for being apathetic at a young age i was called mature by those older than me due to my lack of showing emotions i thought it was normal up until major life events would happen whether positive or negative and in between when i would not feel a single thing except for severe apathy,1
i am so excited to move to my new hometown this day is finally in sight and ive been waiting for years and its finally here i am finally leaving the ghetto shithole where ive suffered and been depressed and wanted to die for 18 long hard years and moving to a resort town of 1500 people near a beautiful beach my new hometown is away from all the filthy smog in the city and overall the attitude of the people is miles ahead of my old place no longer will i be blankly stared at by losers and degenerates nowadays i will be waved at and have pleasant conversation with my refined gentlemanly and ladylike neighbours now i can safely go for walks to a quiet park thats not filled with disgusting people and not have to worry about some assholes untrained pitbull or rottweiler going nuts and attacking me i also can walk in peace knowing that there arent any dipshits driving full speed while having horrible music on full blast i can hear the birds singing theres ample forest that i can likely go hunting in and i think my romantic and sexual mating chances are very high since theres lots of beautiful beach babes down a few blocks from my house p i am so extremely hyped to move there ive been depressed and felt unwelcome long enough now it is time to live the high life and embrace my true happy self thats long waited to truly show special thanks to everybody whos helped me at least survive through the doldrums you all know who you are this is straight up one of the best things to ever happen to me ever period i am thrilled beyond belief,0
cant afford university university is about to start in a week and my student loan got declined because apparently i havent held a residence class visa for 3 years ive lived in this country 16 years with one but when you renew your passport it says your permanent residency starts on the date your passport is renewed i called them and told them it was bullshit and they said i need to send my first passport that held my permanent residency from when i was a baby this seems incredibly illogical because i was in a similar situation last year that required me to hold my residence class visa for atleast 3 years aswell and that had gotten approved the only difference now is that my passport is renewed the student loan process can take up to a month and there is simply no way that it will be approved within a week before the start date of the university which is when the fees are due i am now forced to pay out of pocket which i can only afford for the first semester and that will deplete my entire savings account furthermore if my student loan doesnt get processed in time for the second semester im forced to drop out and work which seems very likely if this is a hiccup in their system i know things could be worse but i am incredibly annoyed at how the company that offers the student loan service simply looked at the renewal date of my passport and declined i would assume there are other ways to confirm how long ive held a permanent residency status other than a renewal date thanks to anyone reading this far,1
im begging somebody to read this i desperately need to feel like i have a friend there for me right now posting this on a few subs because i dont know what to do i feel like ive reached my breaking point im so tired im so tired of existing im so tired of being mad im so tired of being tired its pathetic im a 25 year old adult whos stuck living at home with my family i can feel myself falling apart and im reaching the point where im finally just going to take myself out of this shitty game called life or im going to end up cutting ties all together with my family which is where ill probably sink if its sink or swim out in the big world i am holding on to so many grudges from so many years that i clearly cant cope with in a healthy way my heart hurts so much but im such a glutton for punishment that i cant bring myself to stop carrying around all this hate and it is absolutely one hundred percent consuming me alive ill try and use brackets to section off my thoughts since i doubt anybody cares enough to actually read this all the way through my thoughts on my father as an adult now i realize that i spent probably the first 18 years of my life living in literal fear of my pseudo racist father i still remember being 6 years old or so and hearing my mother scream for my brother because my father was choking her in their bedroom was a big steroid fan back in the day i spent most of my middle school and high school career grounded from one semester to the next one because i frequently got cs in school which my parents would ground us for even one c on the report card and it was grounded for the rest of the semester i still remember getting in trouble so badly for lying about doing my homework not even so much for not doing my homework but it was distinctly about lying about it my father was beating me in our dining room and at one point was physically choking me against the wall and i remember my mother saying well dont choke him insert name and him looking straight at her with his hands around my neck saying im not choking him i still remember that same night him having to come in my room to change my ice packs on my swollen face and how petrified i was that the gameboy sp i was playing was flung off the bed in a room with no carpet because i was certain i was going to get beat again i remember going to school the next and having to tell my teachers because all six of them forced me to stay after class and talk about it that i was playing football with my brother and fell on a sprinkler funny how their response to me lying about homework was to in turn go to school and lie about why half of my face was swollen and black i remember the first time i was ever caught shoplifting was obviously my last time doing it too when my dad came to pick me up he was already so nasty to me before leaving the store that the police threatened to not let me leave because he was already trying to hit me in front of them but you know now that im an adult and have been jumped literally just because of my sexuality if im going to get my ass beat im going to get my ass beat im just not living in fear anymore my thoughts on my brother which brings me to my brother who as of lately might as well be dead to me we have not currently spoken since april and as far as im concerned we probably wont ever speak again lets start with me saying i feel like my brothers relationship with me has always been from the start me bailing him out when he needs it i remember being in elementary school and him getting to go back to sleep after my mother woke us up for breakfast and would leave for work because it was my job to wake him up after rugrats when he was about 12 or 13 he got mixed up with a bad neighborhood kid and ended up almost lighting an entire house on fire in our neighborhood the police officers were nice enough to offer him the deal that if you stay out of trouble until youre 18 this will be completely removed off your record with no trace of it ever even happening sure enough he starts smoking weed in high school which is back when it was highly frowned upon and guess who had to take every single drug test for his four years of high school my dumb ass bailing him out again until finally he got caught coming back late from lunch upper class men were at the time allowed to leave campus for lunch and he came back with a hotboxed car and didnt air it out so when the principle stopped him to ask why he was late she was literally hit with a cloud of smoke my brother was the sole reason my high school was no longer allowed to leave campus for lunch my brother and father have always had an awful relationship too obviously all this places even more tension on it and eventually lead to him either being kicked out or leaving i dont remember which being on the streets on his own he was arrested more times for carrying stupid large amounts of weed on him because he sells it and eventually got charged i think with robbery then to top it all off a few years ago my brother got mixed up in the flocka epidemic and of course theres my dumbass bailing him out again being forced to put two stolen bikes in my car and drive him to miami when i first started realizing how much i hated him was i think my senior year of high school my parents had gone out of town leaving him in charge i remember distinctly it was the night before vans warped tour hes in a huge fight with his at the time girlfriend because he was literally hitting either her or her andor her kid and i remember he stormed into my room flinging open the door trying to use me as an excuse isnt this okay because its what dad used to do to us of course having a criminal record he couldnt find a job and was on probation at my parents house and because nobody wanted to hire somebody with his record they literally gave him a fucking job at the company my father works for this job is 15 an hour gets benefit and vacation days i on the other hand spent years being treated like shit in jobs two years ago i worked for quiksilver over the course of about a year finally left because they told me and a coworker that we were the ones being considered for management and yet they brought in two outside hires after the second one the other coworker had the sense to leave my dumb ass stayed thinking well now that shes gone itll look better on me which is when they brought in another outside hire who i was eventually cool with i just stopped offering to do the management work for sales associate pay until i finally got so fed up that i transferred to gamestop because they were willing to start me as a keyholder since i already had basic management training so two years trying to work for a manager only to be shit on by my parents because its not full time and at your age your brother worked full time at my age yall gave him a fucking career because nobody wanted to hire a literal criminal anything i do its just never going to be good enough let me talk about our most recent altercation because its a fantastic transition into my mother as of last april i was unfortunately unemployed thanks to this whole virus outbreak and of course that sets off my family members because i sleep all day while they work so my mother asked me on april 20th the day before my birthday a day that i was operating on approximately 2 hours of sleep because im always up all night if i could go help my brother in the warehouse where he works because he really needs it i have already had altercations with my brother there from helping him a previous time it was so bad that they sent me home early so being there in general makes me uncomfortable even when i go in to help my dads department so of course i didnt want to help which wasnt an acceptable answer to my mother and after about the 5th time of her saying something obviously i snapped and agreed to which she responded forget it and slammed my door shut it should be noted that in my mothers defense im a nightmare to wake up because of how little i sleep there are times i wake up and am in a fight with my mother because she apparently tried to wake me up and i was nasty meanwhile i have literally no recollection of even speaking to her so my dumb ass trying to bite the bullet agrees to go work for eight hours in a hot sweaty warehouse with barely any ac on my birthday of all days i woke up that morning still mad about the fight i had with my mother the day prior because i feel like as a grown ass adult i should be allowed to say no i dont want to do something get to the warehouse work the shift i leave at five which apparently was a mistake because i wasnt supposed to leave until 5 30 which i thought was fine because 1 i genuinely thought they left at 5 every day and 2 i didnt take a lunch break because i was hoping if we happened to get everything done early we would just be able to leave obviously that was wrong and i got a shitty passive aggressive text message from my brother having already been in a bad mood from my fight with my mother the day before partnered with my brother annoying me after i had left i stopped by aunts house to vent because i was literally seeing red wasnt even planning on going home for my birthday because i just didnt want to be around any of them the next day comes and i dont show up because not only did i not want to be there but when i had gotten there the day before another employee of that company said we dont know if well need you tomorrow or not yet so i just didnt bother to show up because if yall needed me you should have worked that into your text message when you were being an asshole in my opinion so of course my petty ass isnt going to show up my brother comes home through the door doesnt even put his shit down and is in my face screaming at me for not showing up why should i have to explain to my boss why you didnt come why do you get to sleep all day while we work im sick of it turning to my mother im sick of him arent yall sick of him to which she agrees probably just trying to get him to calm down but i wont ever for a second forget you just said you were sick of me and of course im running my mouth back in return which is when he decided to put his hands on me shoving me literally to the floor and this is about where i black out with anger because i had my nintendo switch in my hand the limited edition no longer in production animal crossing themed one at that so obviously im pissed and yank his playstation out of the wall and slam it on the ground you can skip the next parentheses part if you dont care about why a stupid video game console made me so upset a detour to mention about these video game consoles my brother and i used to exclusively use xbox but i made the transition to the ps4 when it came out my brother didnt i had been asking for a playstation 4 since they came out for both my birthday and christmas for i think like two years until the year my brother spent christmas in jail because he was addicted to flocka when my mom finally bailed him out because she felt like he was actually clean he got a playstation 4 when i asked why he got one and i didnt despite it literally being the only thing i asked for as a christmas gift she said well he wasnt here for christmas so i had to make it special i think i eventually got the playstation for my birthday the following year but this fucking switch man i swore up and down when i was a gamestop employee that they were going to make an animal crossing version and they all laughed at me said if it was going to happen it would have already and talked me into buying just a standard switch instead low and behold a few weeks later the animal crossing one is announced and im lowkey heartbroken that i just spent a majority of my money on the standard one i eventually get myself so worked up over it that i asked my mom to front me the money to buy the new system and i will give her 200 when i sell my switch and the rest from my next paycheck shes talking some i cant i dont have that kind of money which would have been totally fine i was just embarrassed that i not only put my pride away to ask for money but was also upset enough about not getting the animal crossing one to even be in this situation so whatever whatever we end up agreeing on if i sell the console first and give her the two hundred she will give me the rest where as i was only asking her for the front because i didnt want to risk selling my console before the new one came out and risk then not having a console at all especially since i had already missed like two years of the switches lifespan so obviously im super thankful to my mom and i literally spent like two days thanking her and talking to her about it only for me to find out that she had given me my own money i dont know what it was for possibly my unemployment since the console came out around the time the virus was starting to flare and at that point all i can keep thinking is wow you really kept my own money from me made me gamble on being able to find a limited edition console without a preorder and told me you couldnt loan me anything that makes me so mad how are you going to lie about my own damn money serves me right i guess for not being adult enough to stop using our joint bank account anyway i slam his playstation on the ground after he put his hand on me the first time we get into a screaming match in his room to which i say something along the lines of youre allowed to knock my switch out of my hand so why should you expect any different of your playstation to which he responds talking out of his ass well you didnt pay for it mom did jokes on you asshole not only did i pay for it entirely with my money but our mother literally withheld my own money from me and made it more difficult for me to get an already difficult to get console this ends up with him coming back into my room because everyone in my family myself included has to have the last word in argument which leads to him putting his hands on me a second time except this time since theres not a 400 gaming system in my hand i pull his disgusting ass down with me this whole fight somehow ends with me being kicked out of my house by my mother my thoughts on my mother fun fact maybe about a week before this my mother was begging me to stop going out despite taking precautions with a mask and specially made sanitizer consisting of primarily alcohol because they had a friend in critical condition from covid this is the same woman who threw her kid out into streets during the first peak of this epidemic im in florida so it is at this moment higher than that first peak because floridians are trash so i spend the next three or four day sleeping in my car doing whatever trying to manage on my own spending what little money i had fixing the joycon drift on my switch that was non existent until my brother attacked me with it in my hand one thing leads to another and i eventually end up back home i asked my mom if we could start family therapy because im literally holding onto grudges that i dont know how to let go of she says when all of this is over but im positive shes forgotten about it and it might very well be what causes me to cut her out all together a few days ago me and my mother got into a huge arguement because she woke me up to ask me to take her to firestone to pick up her carim exhausted but totally not a problem to me at all so i get right up get dressed grab my keys and when i walk out of my room she goes are you ready now im not in a rush or anything i was a little annoyed by the stupid question ill admit like you just two minutes ago came into my room to wake me up and ask me to take you yes im ready to go lol otherwise id still be asleep she of course takes my flat response a slight mixture of both my annoyance and exhaustion as me being in a bad mood so we get into my car and shes overreacting because my car is a little shaky which im almost positive is just because i need air in my tires talking some oh my god we have to pull over what if you have a flat like we definitely would know if we were driving on a flat tire its been doing this since like the second week i got this car so im just sitting there trying to get to the destination as fast as possible trying to hold my tongue and not cause a fight when she sets me off and says something along the lines of youre in a bad mood because i asked you to take me my response being oh what im in a bad mood because i got right up to do something you asked me to do which fucking infuriated me and caused a screaming match in my car i dont understand why she has this god complex where she thinks she gets to tell other people how they feel about something she did it to me on my birthday too which i forgot to mention and am now too lazy to go back and add in but like it drives me crazy i dont care if theyre right wrong or somewhere in between nobody has the right to decide how somebody feels about something except for that person so when i sit there and tell you im not mad and you tell me yes you are mad thats why youre being shitty thats a self fulfilling prophecy right there of course that shits going to make me mad if youre just going to decide im in a bad mood for me then shit i guess im in a bad fucking mood then so this screaming match in my car leads to her saying i hope something happens to your car and when it does dont call me i will never ever in a million years forget she said that to me i hope that when something does happen to my car im inside of it i hope its something fatal and i hope she has to live with it for the rest of her life and then of course after our screaming match she sends me a passive aggressive text message because apparently my family is famous for doing that shit talking some i wont be screamed at in a car that i bought you you are so disrespectful the next time you talk to me like that you can find a new place to live as if she didnt kick me out when i was 16 and 18 and 23 like clearly i can manage in my car bitch try me i would rather starve to death on the streets than feel like i need help from someone who treats me like shit skip the parentheses if you dont care about context with my car history both me and my brother were fortunate enough to get cars for our 16th birthday the difference between us is my brother has wrecked i think 2 cars my parents bought him one car they gave him because my mom got a new car which that one he wasnt at fault for but still its a car to add to your tally and ruined one of my dads trucks that he was using for whatever reason one day i on the other hand drove the same car that i had since i was 16 until literally this year when i turned 25 and was given a new one but honestly my parents had been trying to buy me another one for a few years i just fought them on it because i didnt want a new car which i will explain why later and then now just today we are in another arguement because i think last night my brother walked out our back gate to go sell drugs in our mailbox because he thinks hes cool and tough and can handle jail as if he isnt literally crying mommy bail me out when hes in there as hes going out he knocks over the ashtray i had been using over there which was admittedly in the walkway but only because that particular night i was in a hurry to relocate under my backyard awning because it was raining and i had all my technology on me but when he walks back he has the nerve to say to me your ashtray is knocked over as if i wasnt outside and heard him kick it over like im supposed to lean up after him despite us having literally not a said a word to eachother since april so i hid the ashtray that he normally uses with the mindset of if he needs an ashtray hell have to go over and clean up the one he kicked over only for me to find that my mother ended up being the one to clean up his mess which of course infuriated me and then she had the nerve to defend him in a text message after we got into an arguement about it well it is your ashtray okay did i kick over my ashtray or did my brother because thats the person who should have cleaned it up was who knocked it over in regards to my mother specifically it hurts me the most because i often at times feels like shes the only one out of the 3 of my immediately family that i could have a relationship with or that i actively want to have a relationship with and that bridge is so close to being burnt to a crips i dont want to appear ungrateful because as a mother she does go above and beyond ive been spoiled sure but my problem with it is i feel like my mother only gives as much as she gives so that she has ammunition to hold over peoples head i fought her for years about getting a new because i knew she would just hold it over my head which obviously i was right about i remember being kicked out when i was 18 because i wasnt working and i had just gotten kicked out of college and she said leave your keys pack your stuff and find somewhere to live so i did set off with no car no money no nothing ended up being taken in by my best friends family spent a year or two there and i literally did not get my car back the same one she had given me at 16 until the girl i was living with literally called her in tears asking if we could just borrow it so we could go see her mother who was in the hospital because she needed brain surgery literal brain surgery was the only reason i got my car back and it still took my friend like two or three times of asking my mother for her to let me use my car just to take her to see her mother my father has always babied me and let me get away with more than he lets my brother get away with i can admit that the problem with it is that because i dont feel the same type of yearning for a relationship about my father that i do about my mother i dont really care about him favoring me and because my dad tends to let me get away with more my mom feels like she has to let my brother get away with more which in turn causes me to always just feel like im chasing my mothers approval or some shit thoughts on my own disgusting self its only been recently that im starting to come around to my father and thats only because i think im starting to hate my mother i know i probably sound ungrateful and entitled and i can see why but i am truly thankful for how privilege ive been and all that ive been given but i dont know how to not feel the way that i feel about these things and thats not to say im perfect either ive caused plenty of problem for my family so let me just skip to all my flaws now when i was a kid like before i could even start kindergarten i was literally already sucking dick my next door neighbor my brothers age at the time used to make me do it to him and i used to agree because he was considerably nicer to me when i do would so he was already a problem child too but thats neither here nor there i was pretty much only sucking him off because my brother always hated when i would hang out with him and his friends and the neighbor always let me hang around for obvious reasons distinctly remember my brother catching us a few times but i guess nothing was ever done about it not even sure if my parents know about it but as an adult i can see thats where i started getting fucked up idk if i necessarily blame my neighbor for me being gay because i do firmly as a gay man believe that its just who you are and cant be changed but i feel like there will literally always be a part of me that questions it like what if i wasnt sucking dick at five years old would i be interested in girls i remember having a crush on at least two different girls before i met what i now as an adult realize was probably my first boy crush like looking back on my child hood i vividly remember playing doctor with other kids or truth or dare that always ended sexual and i realize like damn thats fucking gross we were all kids fast forward to me being in i think middle school and i was caught sexually experimenting with my cousin i was definitely old enough to know better so i take fault there but i also wasnt ever the one initiating it you know i was letting him suck me off for longer than i can remember honestly but i also distinctly remember i wasnt the one initiating it i still remember the first night at his house when he asked me to go pornhub and grilling him about how he even knows about that i dont remember when i started letting him do stuff to me but i know that i shouldnt have i remember well enough that when he would come sleepover there were times i would opt to stay up late with my father in hopes that he would fall asleep waiting for me to come in i remember one time i was up late and he comes walking out like 2 hours after being put to bed because he was trying to get me to come in to bed with him but again i was the older kid in that situation so thats my fuck up obviously when we got caught it put a wedge between that side of our family i can see why but in hindsight i always wonder would you have still distanced yourself if you knew it was your son who had been initiating it because he was younger all the blame was pushed onto me and i can see why again i should have known better thats probably around the time i started getting fat by high school at one point i was over 300 pounds and openly gay never had a serious relationship never even had someone interested in a relationship with me i can see why not only was i cringey in high school but i was literally disgusting it wasnt till about my senior year i finally got back under 300 pounds and started losing some weight and gaining some confidence but heres the kicker before i started losing the weight i had become a literal serial catfisher and im talking like anybody you wanted to see naked i would go out of my way to target friends friends boyfriends nobody was off limits to me it makes me sick thinking about the hundreds of people ive catfished because i was horny and lonely catfishing even basically got me kicked out of my college granted i was surprisingly innocent at that time but because the kid found out about me being a catfish he refused to believe it wasnt me despite me literally having to show my catfish accounts to the dean and them not matching up to whoever he was talking to the college only realized their mistake a semester or two later because the kid was immediately put on academic probation the semester following my suspension and then got caught trying to do the same thing to another gay student the semester after that which is when they were like wow we were wrong were so sorry dont even worry about the requirements we gave you for coming back you can just come back never did though it wasnt only until i hit maybe 22 or 23 that it like clicked with how awful what i was doing was and started making an active effort to stop it and i feel like i was only even willing to because i fell in genuine love with somebody i was catfishing when i finally told him we were fine for a few days he told me he didnt care that i was a guy because he fell in love with the person behind a screen but all of that quickly crumbled to ashes thats another one thats my own fault not only was i doing something shitty but i was also in too deep i think i still to this day get texted from somebody i started catfishing when i was about 15 or 16 that i just am too afraid to finally tell the truth to but since the recent heart break ive thankfully been able to almost entirely remove catfishing from life save for the one guy i was in too deep with and the old catfish accounts that i occasionally log into when im desperately alonehornywhatever it may be im tired of feeling alone i just want to be loved i want someone to want me to care about me im starting to realize this world is awful almost every thing and everyone in it is bleak some people genuinely want to live long happy lives me personally i dont think i can make it doing this shit for another 25 years self deprecating jokes and suicidal humor are my biggest weapons because i feel like if i dont turn them into jokes ill let them overcome me too many people in this world are awful i dont want to be one anymore i doubt any of you will actually care enough to read this through but if you for some unknown reason did then i thank you because i could really use a friend tldr im a scumbag im starting to think my family is scumbags and im genuinely losing my will to live ive been holding on to grudges that are literally consuming me and transforming me into a being of hatred and it makes me sick to my stomach i dont know how much longer i can do this but god i would absolutely love to just be taken out by a bus tomorrow,1
why do i have to do this most of the time im in a good mood of course i have bad and good days but sometimes there are those days when everything seems so pointless to me and the pressure just overwhelms me where i wonder why why does everything have to be so shitty why is everything i do wrong why am i here why cant everything be different and why must i put such a high pressure on me why do i have to be perfect why cant i just be let go let me live and not treat me like shit like an animal that has to be punished for its existence for its very existence wiping out that existence just feels right sometimes,1
should i tell my father about my chronic stomach pain due to stress about 2 years ago i started having terrible stomach pains all the time which were usually worsened by any kind of stress that i faced throughout the day last year my father became very worried about this and decided to take me to the doctor to see what could be causing it my bowel movements were regular i avoided foods that i was allergic to and the doctor could not find anything wrong but i did not mention my stress to her at the time after this visit i took a blood test and an ultrasound but i seemed to be in perfect health then we saw a gi doctor and i finally decided to ask if my stress levels were part of the cause of my stomach pain after i explained the situation a little more he told me that my issues were definitely stress related and that i should visit a psychiatrist he also advised me to start taking therapy i actually used to take therapy for something other than stress i had been regularly engaging in self harm and fallen into the deep pits of depression about a year before my stomach pains had started so when my father found out he asked me to start taking therapy it worked great and i loved going but i think we all know that therapy is pretty expensive my father has a good stable job and is paid well enough but my mother doesnt have a job and he has two children we try not to spend too much money but continuing to get therapy on his salary is just impossible so i stopped taking therapy after we moved cities my father started getting paid around 20000 more per year after the move and we started living in an area where rent is much more reasonable a few months ago my father told me that he wanted me to start taking therapy again if my stomach pain would not go away but i knew that he would still have a difficult time affording it i also knew that he was having a hard time sleeping at night because of the stress that i was causing him i love my father a lot and i dont want to trouble him any more than i already do so i started lying to him and saying that my stomach doesnt hurt anymore i thought i would be able to keep up the lie but the pain seems to only be getting worse what should i do,1

does anybody else have a friendor so that is a good friend youve had a long time but every text conversation usually ends up with you feeling drained irritated and in a really bad mood alright ill try not to make this super long so basically i have been really good friends with someone for like 5 years and is always there for me to turn to when i need his help and will do about anything that i may ask always has my back etc i really value him and how he always helps me to not worry because he will never let me downbut i feel like every conversation for lack of a more fitting wordthat he is constantly cutting me off even before i get a chance to respond before he starts talking again dominating the whole conversation and bombards me text after text after text not giving me any time to reply to anything and if i do get a message in it doesnt make much difference on what im feeling and trying to get across and its only after he sends 45 texts before mine shows up in the thread before what i said was acknowledged and addressed and then after its briefly talked about then he again just talks and talks and sends numerous texts in a row and wont fucking shutup until i get to the point of overwhelming anger taking full control over me and then i end up having an anxiety attack that doesnt end for at least 30mnz after i have cussed him out or attempted to and completely cut off wasting one more minute of time and quit the conversation for good feeling drained of everything and out of energy sorry this was a little longer than i expected and i hope makes sense because its been a long really bad day and im trying to come across as able to make sense of i would like to know if anyone has gone thru this or anything similar and what did you do that stopped it from happening ever again,1

can i be treated for depression without admitting i have suicidal thoughts to my doctor for the first time in my life im looking to get professional help and id like some advice based on other peoples experiences first my issue is that i dont want to admit i have suicidal thoughts to anyone not even the doctor im visiting in case my parents request a copy of my medical information i also cant go to therapy for it at the moment anyway and out of all other symptoms i feel least emotionally ready to talk about that one or the attempt ive made in the past my parents are for the most part homeopathic and im listed as a dependent under their insurance plan im both neglected and kept on a very tight leash if that makes sense eg only being taken to the dentist once my teeth were already heavily deteriorated im no longer a minor but i still live with them and i cant drive myself anywhere or maintain a job as im mentally crippled nor do i have friends to help me my doctors visit is under the guise of fainting from frequent migraines which is true my parents are paying for it and fortunately they cant tell the difference between a neurologist and a psychiatrist in case of a referral im planning to bring up depression to the doctor at the same time and will use all personal parttime money to pay for whatever else but will diagnosis or treatment change if i omit important facts like suicide i want to quickly get better focus and leave this place i cant afford be locked up by my parents i know next to nothing about going to the doctors so maybe none of this is a valid concern,1

is it normal to feel stressed while doing things that used to relax me just like everyone else my lifes been pretty stressful the last year ive usually dealt with stress and anxiety by doing relaxing things to me like looking at memes reading and playing the piano im very bad at it but i like to follow youtube tutorials recently ive noticed that anytime ive tried to learn a new piece or do something more complex while playing ive immediately become very anxious my heart beat speeds up and i get very uncomfortable this is all very weird because ive never had these panic attack type things i know its not a real panic attack and im not trying to diminish a real one its just the best euphemism i can come up with and ive never had a problem learning more complex things on the piano is it normal to eventually feel stressed by something that used to do the opposite theres no one forcing me to play the piano no obligations to it and nothing that should make me feel stressed about it,1
can stress cause hallucinations and psychosis so ive been incredibly stressed lately to the point of not being able to move and having near constant panic attacks i lost my job because i wasnt able to keep up with tasks due to anxiety and stress im on multiple medications none of which seem to help ive been seeing shadowy figures out of the corner of my eye dark shadows of people standing over me staring intently animals scurrying across the floor or road sometimes just moving dots and lights recently ive been having very vivid dreams which alternate between watching myself commit suicide or watching myself commit the murder of my significant other i have random thoughts of how i can kill myself or of destroying something or if someone died how id dispose of the body i dont know what is wrong with me but i am scared,1
lacking the will to keep going its been like this for too long ive tried everything in the past medication psychotherapy etc but i just cant improve my life i was first diagnosed in 2005 and there have certainly been good and bad times since then but one thing ive never been able to overcome is that im lazy i simply lack the willpower to even do basic things i am approaching my 30th birthday and im nowhere near where i want to be in life and with no realistic prospects of being there any time soon i dont own a home im so far off being ready to marry my girlfriend no kids struggling to get my career off the bottom rung of the ladder ive been plagued by thoughts of ending it all for quite a while now and to be honest the only thing keeping me here is that i cant inflict that pain on people who care about me but existing for the sake of preventing others pain is so far from a satisfying or meaningful existence i have no idea how to turn this around and the passage of time will only make this worse as i continue this unsatisfying existence im not on the brink yet but the longer this goes on the closer i feel ill get and i feel so helpless as i watch myself deteriorate,1
my depression gets worse during the holidays ive noticed that my depression gets worse during christmas my birthday new years july 4th etc i wonder if its because i feel really lonely while everyone is celebrating does anyone else feel the same way,1
19year old in need of help and guidancr hi everyone im a 19year old male just finished highschool i will get straight to the point college is too expensive parents cant afford it even if they can i wouldnt want to burden them i will want to pay for my own college but the problem right now is that my parents are retired im really worried that my parents wont have enough money to pay rent i cant help them because my parents dont allow me to get a job because of the covid i know im an adult but i dont have a driving license or a car yet so instead im just learning to code day till night every single day i need at least 6month to be job ready i hope that i can get a front end job by then i have many things to learn web design color theory seo coding etc i have only just started learning to code 1month ago i feel so stupid and idiotic for not starting it earlier negative thoughts have been haunting me recently is like i develop another personality this personality only thinks of the bad thing for example like wanting to stab someone myself thinking of parents passing away etc this kind of thoughts is appearing more often with each day passing also there is a side of me that feel like im missing out because all of my friends and classmate are all in college this kind of negative thinking didnt appear at all when i was in school but because i heard from parents that they dont have enough money is been bothering me ever since i wont blame my parent and i know where i am now i will work my way to get it but my headache and stress is getting worse every passing day im not taking any day off im very worried that my parents wont have enough money to pay rent im worried that i wont have enough time to learn the things needed im really scared that my parent 60yo will passed away early all of this is stressing me out really badly i want to help them but i dont know how i can help i dont have allowance worse is that i dont have any skill or talent i feel like i dont have enough time to learn the things i need to learn because there so many sometimes it doesnt even get absorbs by my head because im rushing it also recently ive been biting my nail and scratching my head till bleeding i never had this habit before,1
stress equals more colds hey guys in the past i had a weak immune system and during really stressful phases at my job i got sick a lot faster to a point where i almost always had a cold did anyone had similar experiences its interesting because not everyone gets that response when exposed to negative stress what are or were your struggles,1
my boyfriend is severely depressed and sent me the following texts please tell me what should i do it breaks my heart to see him like this he talks about our relationship and his life situation in general pd he recently started going to therapy the texts there are acts that can be very valuable but to no avail i have known for months that it is a lost and absurd battle that is not worth fighting and things have happened accordingly and got worse we could not do it separately nor together we could not do it in more favorable situations we cannot do it now it would simply be absurd it would be better for you to dedicate your time to yourself or anything else it is simply useless already it was useless half a year ago and it is now more than ever theres no need on making a great effort if it has to be useless i consider the help not yours but from anyone useless given the situation and i think time has proved me right everything has gone from bad to worse it would be absurd to think that things could work out in december i told you that no matter how much you wanted it was not viable that it would become a struggle between you and depression and that we could not win in any way and everything has happened like this i am able to distinguish my thoughts from reality yet it is very heartbreaking to see him like this he has said these things to me many times so it doesnt come as a surprise to me that he thinks this way but it is still hard he always ends up coming back to me and i want to be supportive of him and do whatever i have to do best so it allows him to feel at least a bit safer with me 59 feel that he is actually not alone and that getting better is not impossible but he keeps pushing me away what should i really do,1

whats the point a cureless existence clinical depression is an imbalance of chemicals in your brain that causes depression we have way to measure the levels of these chemicals we dont know what the good level is supposedly its different for everyone we have no idea how much a given dosage of a given drug is going to affects the levels in someones brain and even if youre lucky enough to get on a drug dose that workstheres a high chance youll have to stay on it forever and even a chance that it will become ineffective and you will have to be put something else honestly i am just tired of iti dont want to deal with it anymore because it is exhausting and being told that you will mostly likely be dealing with something you have no control over for the rest if your life makes me wonder is it even worth it,1

no matter the location most cultures have recognized the sun as the prime controller of all life on earth because without it life here could not exist as the earth rotates daily on its axis every morning the sun brings light to the darkness warmth and comfort to the chill of night photo synthesis to plants and security to humans its for this reason that as far back as 14000 8ce adoration of the sun has been sketched onto stone tablets and cave walls countless mythologies including civilizations in ancient egypt and mesopotamia the mayans and the aztecs and the australian aborigines to name just a few have extolled the sun as worthy of worship as well as a source of enlightenment illumination and wisdom while the sun may be almost 93 million miles away when it becomes active it has significant consequences to life on earth because the earth and the sun are related by electromagnetic fields on a grand scale it is impossible to deny the interconnectivity between the suns energy the earths energy and the energy of all living species on a micro level all you have to do is look at the life cycle of a fruit or vegetable to understand this interdependence consciously absorbing that energy to combine with your own spiritual energy has tremendous benefits for your astral body physical health and much more your spiritual energy goes under many different names like spiritual chills euphoria voluntary goosebumps ecstasy prana chi qi vayus aura mana life force pit rapture ruah ether nephesch chills frissons the force and many more heres a 3 minute youtube video expanding more on the benefits and how to actually absorb the energy from the sun through your own selfinduced voluntary goosebumps from positive eventsthoughtsmemoriesfeelings,0
i feel like an empty shell thats pretty much it honestly im a person who gets bored so so easily of books games shows physical hobbies and even or especially people nearly everything ive had a consistent obsessive interest in has to do with psychology or neuroscience all so i could find out something about myself the thing answers relief but really im just normal boring with extremely unrealistic expectations its like im a broken bucket no matter what and how much i add to my life id be left with nothing within hours a few days if im lucky sure i feel lonely but i have damn good friends were close we connect so well i have a great support system yet im more likely to avoid all that because its not stimulating enough or perhaps not stimulating in the right ways nothing personal what are the right ways absolutely no idea at the end of that day i find myself back to the void whether im pulled back into it forcefully or idk i sought it out myself out of fear seeking familiar comfort doesnt really matter oh i know this will pass something will spark my interest eventually but i will come back to the emptiness after its a cycle clearly and im simply so very tired of reliving it and being stuck,1

im freakin out man hey reddit i just searched for this sub so that i could vent a little im pretty stressed right now about my finances and id just like to type mindlessly for a few minutes i have a very steady and regular income with no fear of losing my job any time soon i love what i do and it pays better than anything ive ever done before it due to the nature of things i have to schedule vacations a year out and being relatively young and naive i decided it would be a good idea to schedule time off in july for my birthday and to visit my family in kansas city area and then again august to see my family in alaska each trip was a week long some of you may already see the error of my ways i was semiprepared for the vacation in july but it wasnt until after the trip that i realized the flight for my wife and i to alaska was going to be about double what i was expecting needless to say i was financially unprepared for the trip but already committed tickets in hand the trip itself was a dream and i loved every minute of it near the end of my trip i realized just how unprepared i was when i woke up and had 45 in my bank account i still needed to drive home after my flightin order to save about 300 i drove 6 hours to the cheapest airport around me cost of gas was about 70 round trip for a total savings of about 225 it was worth it to me due to this and the fact i still had some bills to pay i headed over to rborrow and took out a loanwhich i have since paid back that covered me until i got paid until yesterday when i realized i was yet again behind causing me to take another loan outless than before so i guess i am technically ahead i sent out a check for my mortgage and it bounced im a month behind on bills and im practically living at biolifeplasma donation right now trying to make ends meet i transferred 35 into my bank account from my biolife cards so my mortgage check would go through im at my wits end and dont see a solution in sight im stressed beyond belief please dont comment on here telling me im a shithead for not managing my finances well i know that and next month after i get paid im doing absolutely nothing extra shit i might live on ramen this month if i have to i need help dealing with this stress and really could use some help anything,1

just go to therapy i see this here and other subs a lot people vent about how shitty their lives are going or how theyre feeling honestly is anyone having a good time right now and the answers are usually go to therapy on the one hand yea therapy is good for mental health shit but its not that easy to actually get in especially in my country it took me a year to find a therapist that wasnt booked and was open before 9 and after 5 which was a non starter because lo and behold offices and jobs tend to want you working for them between 9am5pm so you cant go gallivanting off to talk to your therapist for an hour finally found one and come to find out my insurance wont cover them going to this therapist costs me 99 a week thats more than i spend on groceries i make a decent amount and havent yet been sacked because of covid but not many are as lucky as i rant tldr therapy isnt easy to get into and isnt cheap go to therapy is not a solution many people can take,1

i wish i didnt wake up today so this is my first time posting here or being here in fact but i dont know where else to go its only 9 12 am where i live as im writing this im in the middle of online class i woke up at 2 am and couldnt sleep again so i decided to go to youtube to kill time between 5 and 6 am ive listened to a few songs that only made me feel really sad and brought back bad memories including one that ive frequently thought that i should listen to in case i try to kill myself in a way that wasnt instant at this point my suicidal thoughts only got worse and worse to the point i actually pointed a knife to my neck honestly thinking whether i should push in or pull away but im too much of a coward to actually do anything ive decided to check a few old texts and saw that my girlfriend sent me a text i dont think its in my right to share what it said in public but while she didnt say it explicitly its heavily implied that she cheated on me and i cant help but think about how much this hurts so i asked what the fuck she meant by that and all i can do now is wait for an answer and hope that im just a bad person to even think that she did that and that she didnt do what i think she did and now im here in the middle of class thinking what the fuck is the point of all of this just wishing i didnt wake up at all today just so i wouldnt feel all this pain i just want to stop hurting even for a moment but nothing is helping,1

can someone read this its my full story if i can have at least one person read this it would make me feel really happy because someone can get the full picture of my life im a black 17m in highschool who lives in the usa my interests fall in computer science math video games and animemanga when i was younger i loved video games so much and i still do to this day video games were the reason i was planning to work at a game development studio in the future i felt more understood by vgs than i did with my family im not close with my family and i dont ever will be because they are toxic af ive been psychologically abused and nobody would ever listen to my end of the story they are the major cause for my depression and some for my suicidal tendencies as more time passed i would stay in my room as much as i can because i whenever i would step out my parents would drag with them to some store usually insult me or whine about how lazy i am my mom has been more abusive but at the same time she is an idiot who i was able fool on a few occasions my dad is annoying and racist for some ungodly reason he hates white people which makes me embarrassed to have him as a father my stepmom is stupid and racist so i cant stand her certainly least my sister is a literal bitch who has no regard for anyones feelings school is the worst thing to have ever happened to me i dont even know where to begin with school because i have had so much shitty stuff happen to me elementary school was ok i was easy target for harassment but its not as bad as it was in middle school when i was in elementary school i never saw the importance of school i barely did any work and never bothered to pay attention in class almost everyday in elementary school i just looked forward to going home and playing on my nintendo ds it was my major motivation back then then came middle school this is where so many problems came to rise words cannot describe how horrible my middle school experience was this is when school pressure really started hitting me and that i felt the need to work harder i had only like one friend in the beginning of 6 grade and by then i began getting bullied by having that friend this friend of mine was seen as very strange and weird by every other student but i defended him and decided to go through constant harassment so i can keep being his friend one day at the end of the year my science teacher decided to expose me in front of the class because she got so sick of me not turning my work i dont blame her though lol next is 7th grade where there was no end to bullying throughout the school year i tried so hard to fit in and be like everyone else but it really backfired making me look more like an idiot i would do the most retarted shit just for attention because i felt so lonely worst idea ever now those memories are stuck with the other students who went to class with me i asked i crush out and she rejected me wasnt much a big deal but i did feel pretty embarrassed after almost all my friends were fake and would easily turn their back on me whenever i was alone thoughts of self harm would become more frequent and whenever i wasnt i was being harassed by someone the last day of 7th grade is literally the worst day of my life completely lonely the first half then midday i accidentally fell in some chalk that was on the concrete and it ruined the clothes i was wearing that day my friend saw this as the perfect opportunity to embarrass me in front of much other students as he can almost immediately when he found out he literally started running around the school and tried to tell almost anyone nearby about how dumb i looked with chalk on my clothes students nearly when they saw me just gave a weird look or an expression of confusion i was so suicidal that day next is 8th grade not as terrible as 7th but still bad i was admitted into a 9th grade biology class because of my great grades in 7th grade environmental science but the biology class was horrible to be in the teacher was absolute shit and made it harder for us just for the sake of it when i came in that class on the first day i almost had a heart attack because there were so many students who were admitted in this class and i knew none of them some of the other students i sat with hated me because i got some of the concepts confusing insert some more embarrassing moments then you have 8th grade high school is better then middle school but i still hate school in general 9th grade ive never been so lonely 10th grade my existential crisis began 11th grade suicide attempts 12 burnout and more suicide attempts i dont want to treat life as a separate entity but 2020 killed me this year i wish i can just take a mental break but my parents are denying my depressive symptoms doing schoolwork has never been so difficult holy shit if i cant even do it well in high school then how can i do it college life is so horrible i get abused for the most minor things and i dont know what to do anymore i have no idea what to do for the future because i ruined my grades and ive overthought what i want to be when i grow up i attempted suicide like over 10 times this year but none of them work i dont understand why people just wont help me even when i reach out i wish my life just ended by whatever means i dont to be homeless especially at this because its insanely cold outside my point is everything is just not fucking fair i actively try do the most i can to rid depression and do my schoolwork but nobody will fucking cooperate with me even when im having my best day i still always contemplate on suicide as if its the answer to my life i low key wish someone would hug me thank you for reading im grateful to whoever took the time out to read this sorry it was long edit i really want to thank all of you for the kind words really i do i wish i can meet all of you and you guys hugs because i was feeling lonely and felt the need to share i full

makes friends get close really get to know them alienate them slowly with your issues get abandoned yet again several years into another good friendship that you hoped would last a lifetime repeat this pattern has been repeating for over a decade for me i dont still have any friends from then now hell i barely have any friends left from 5 years ago im just so sick of it i thought id broken this cycle but its rearing its head again im being told to just make new friends but what happens a couple of years from now when they get sick of me too and im right back here wallowing in my own feelings of abandonment isolation not belonging etc all over again it just reinforces for me that i dont belong on this planet that as soon as somebody knows the real me our relationship whatever its nature is on borrowed time that im just going to be flitting like a pariah between groups i never quite seem to fit into spending the rest of my life pursuing validation wherever the search takes me next until finally almost mercifully it ends justwhy bother if nobody can love me for the real me and i cant for the life of me mould myself into a shape they can accept whats the point edit thanks for the silver guys i wasnt expecting this to be so well received,1

realizing that you will die because of suicide is really hard sometimes it just really hits me that maybe not today or tomorrow but eventually i will commit suicide this realization really fucks me up i wish this wasnt the case i wish so much i could be normal and happy but its been years and ive begun to really accept that my suicide is inevitable i hope im proven wrong edit its been 160 days since i posted this and although not much has changed in my mindset i still come back often and read all the new comments those of you who commented or will comment i see you and just wanted to say thank you were not alone and although things suck they suck a bit less together,1
being traumatised by a depression hi guys first time posting here but read over the years here and there some posts well as in the title here my situation 3 years ago i started analytic therapy had a girlfriend that time and some heavy anxiety made things very difficult my father died when i was 14 which made it later then hard to love someone without fear well it went really good actually till 2020 the relationship was a lil toxic for me it had a very polarising dynamic it made me depressive september 2020 came along and one day to another it hit me with panic cry attacks mental breakdowns i started taking medication elontril us is wellbutrin or something its simply a bupropion derivate nevermind it was heavy and after a long path of heavy pain i never experienced in my life before the relationship ended now since march a long and slow positive trend happened i basically have no social anxiety what so ever talking to many people and going out actually helps me i also have barely heavy self doubts i like myself and i think i dont deserve this depression at all my main thing is hopelessness that it is or will be chronic that it never ends and i will end up having it forever i have a strong family and friends holding my back and all those actually positive things should make my depression way better or push me out of that but it doesnt which worries me even more now i experience a small downwards spiral againwell i am studying physics and its stressful recently so there might be the reason now to my big worries which may be part of depressive thoughts personshrugging facewithraisedeyebrow the biggest cause of all my shit at the moment is a clearly noticeable wrong affection i see something or feel something or smell something and a depressive feeling comes up no i hate my self or i dont deserve etc no thinking problem rather a feeling problem it is simply just that my own reality seems heavily distorted and i am so good damn fucking afraid of another hell like late 2020 it makes me panic to think about that happening again this depression traumatised more than anything in my distant past my depression gave me such a trauma that it seems to stay it induced it self and i have such a fear that there is now solution to this at all i dont see me as a person how is always struggling with depression it cant be i do except that i am in that position now and a part of me also thinks that every single soul on this planet can overcome an endogene depression non psychiatric for good everyone must find there own way but i feel how this mental state fades recently and it gives me instant panic because depressiontrauma has anyone also such a concrete feeling of being traumatised by the depression itself is there a way to deal with that to break that circle i have to add that i was a hypochondriac but psychoanalysis made it almost go away but i think it is focused now on the depression yall fee me no idea how to deal with that,1

how do i deal with school with depression so im going into the 10th grade this year which for some of you is year 11 but im very worried about how ill be able to keep on top of school last school year i barely did anything at all i couldnt the beginning of my academic downfall was when i was taken into a residential programme to deal with a series of mental problems during and when i got out i felt too morbidly depressed to do pretty much anything especially school work i would never shower never brush me teeth never flush the toilet never clean my bedroom you know the routine my school is very demanding but i was lucky that the faculty was aware that i wasnt able to be as ahead as my peers which helped because it felt as if everything was far too overwhelming to do and i physically could not without my head hurting or something of the sort now that summer is over and school is starting again i have no idea how im going to manage keeping on top of my work i do really want to try my best this year but i can barely complete or start my first few assignments without getting insanely overwhelmed this year i wont get the same leniency as i did last year and honestly i cant say i want it either because it too came with its downsides other kids would get angry at me because i was exempt from doing some assignments and also it made me feel as if id failed at being a human along with everything else i could barely keep on top of my hygiene i wouldnt eat i could barely get out of bed or look the slightest bit decent when leaving the house it was as if i was a baby that had to be carried around due to its helplessness i hated it albeit it was far better than drowning in my own academic failure and being personally held accountable for my lack of effort towards my education in conclusion im wondering how i can keep on top of school work without getting very overwhelmed due to my depression,1
cant keep doing this venting ive always been depressed to some degree since i was very young i knew there was something wrong with my brain but whenever i tried to ask my parents for help or to see someone about it they would brush it off now though years and years later i do see a psychiatrist and im in therapy but i hit an excruciating swing of depression for the past few weeks i cant stop thinking about how much ive screwed up my life how many people ive disappointed how the things ive done and been through are impossible to come back from ive lost weight at an extreme speed because i cant gather the motivation to go make myself something to feed myself or really the motivation to do anything i think about death a lot how it could just end this whole cycle every minute just drags on and its messing with my perception of time and im just so tired of sleeping not wanting to do anything but sleep but then feeling like a failure for not getting anything done i have a couple friends who check up on me but i feel like i dont deserve them i dont wanna bring their mood down it doesnt feel like im being a good friend back and i just really cant keep doing this cant keep waking up feeling exactly the same or worse from the day before i dont know how much longer i can take it,1

overwhelmed by college i have a computer science class for 6 hours once a week on saturdays i feel like everyone is understanding everything and i feel like im the dumbest guy in the class i had one of the lowest scores on my test a 48100 i cant get my program assignment to work while every one else has theirs working like it was no problem and whenever i ask for help i feel like the professor is upset at me because it was something we learned about earlier in the semester i do pay attention in class but i have to get up at 5 00 am to be able to make it to class at 7 00 am for my precal class and i have english 1a and im always scheduled to work from 6 30 pm 10 30 pm at my job giving me almost no time to sleep i understand there are people who are in an even more stressed out situation but fuck man,1
have any of you seen the aftermath of suicide i feel really suicidal right now with school starting tomorrow and all i have nothing to live for as i have lost all my friends and any sort of emotion every time i think about killing myself i go on gore subreddits and look at photos of suicide aftermath and it scares me into survival not like i have access to a gun anyway but it sort of grounds me into the realty of the situation i think about my poor mother finding my head exploded like a pumpkin that would destroy her still thinking about doing it somehow but the fear keeps me from doing it for a short period of time enough time to hopefully distract myself with anything i can find,1
everyday it just gets harder and harder to find a reason to keep going please stop this,1
i want to tell people dont worry i hate myself way more than you could ever hate me like if they are judging me or dont like me trust me i know i hate all of those things about myself and more,1
hi hello i have recently 2 years ago had a panic attack during a certain recreational activity and i have never been able to recover from it i am 22 years old studyingliving abroad and i am very new to stress im not even sure it is stress if i could describe my symptoms then someone would confirm for me that would be great it usually starts with thoughts contemplating life and then spirals out of control even typing it on to this subreddit makes me shudder thoughts of imminent doom and uncertainty i would then go into panic attack mode and wait for the nightmare to be over is this stress or psychosis i sometimes feel im going made recently i started having night terrors extremely vivd ones which i can still remember several months after ive had 3 bad ones so far and sometimes im afraid to go to sleep because of them i dont want to take any medication i know my family has a history of depression and ive heard about the zombifying effect some drugs have my usual stress reliever has been going to the gym but recently ive been having panic attacks there too typing this post has eased my mind somewhat and any comments would probably do the same regards jon,1
im killing myself update so most of you probably didnt even see my post before which is fine obviously but i just felt the need to put this update out for the ones who did 3 days ago i was so close to taking my own life i was going to jump off a bridge and end it all i was drunk so it made matters only worse as i sat there and thought to myself a voice came in my head this voice told me how this was the wrong thing to do that i have so much more going for me and i cant lose my life over some girl so here i am 3 days later the girl and i have discussed what our relationship is going to be like we are on a break as this is a time for me to focus and make myself happy my happiness cant be dependent on another person that is unhealthy ive started seeing a counselor and just doing more staying active i know in the end i can conquer these demons i would just like to say thank you to all of you who reached out to me that night i obviously didnt respond but knowing that a random stranger online cares enough about another stranger to make sure theyre okay well that is special to me thank you once again and i hope every one in this sub finds some sort of happiness in their life we all deserve it this is a disease just like diabetes and you should not be ashamed of it instead face it head on and say fuck you depression im better than you,1

43 and completely lost ive never posted anything online before so ill try to be succinct im 43 male never married no kids on medical leave from my job for depression im so disappointed in the person ive become no matter how much i read or do its like i have not gained any wisdom on managing lifes challenges i grew up in a loving home with lots of encouragement and high expectations i was an a student through college but my social skills have always been lacking i managed to work for the past 20 years but i couldnt keep up in my current job hence the medical leave ive been in therapy for much of the past 10 years my psychologist believes i have traits of avoidant personality disorder i take several antidepressants and im currently two weeks into tms therapy nothing seems to help im unbelievably critical of myself even now as i write this message i am certain that this will be the worst written message ever on reddit ive been reading hundreds of other posts and they seem so well written im even more amazed by the responses how are you all able to find the words to share your wisdom and advice i read everything i can find on overcoming depression and avoiding suicide but it goes right through me and outv the other end with nothing retained i cant imagine giving advice to someone there is so little i can think of to say to people in distress im a mess right now i have lost hope of getting better i dont exercise i sleep 14 hours a day i have a house but i spend most nights at my parents nothing traumatic has ever really happened to me the worst thing is that my exgirlfriend cheated on me three years ago and i havent dated since i have some solid friends that ive known since high school they are all very well adjusted and have careers and families of their own i cant seem to learn anything these days i used to be smart but i am not longer able to learn new things i cant imagine surviving another 40 years i think about volunteering but i even tell myself that i have nothing valuable to offer ive no real skills to rely on i have saved about 300k in my 20 years of work i had saved that money so that i could support having a family some day i no longer think im capable of having a family too overwhelming i would be an awful spouse and father i dont plan to go back to work i plan to just live on my savings as long as i can and then end my life by then my parents will be gone and i wont hurt them my siblings and friends will be hurt in the nearterm but they will be ok in the long run ive read so much on coping with this disease but so little spurs me to action until last year im was microdosing with weed every morning to get myself going keeping up with job and social occasions the weed stopped working for me though now if i smoke it gives me some paranoia that makes things worse thanks for reading all this i love you,1
im a lazy pitiful 35 year old man child that never amounted to anything in his life in debt no degree lives with his mom and can never follow through on anything title says it all my girlfriend broke up with me recently she said i was a man child and she needed an actual man im old now i look back and i dont remember ever growing up i have 2 dwis an entry level job still no college degree and i live at my moms house with her fiance who i cant stand any money i make i either spend it on video games or shopping and i racked up over 30k in debt i dont have a point or goal in my life and i feel like im already dying i could have been something good in my life but here i am alone again every single woman ive been with has left me i cant fucking sustain or follow through with anything i didnt get a degree i dont finish the projects i start every idea ive had has never completeled ive never fit in socially and at the time of writing this post i dont see any real will to live id never kill myself because the people that do care about me would be hurt and i care about them way too much to hurt them so instead im just floating through life barely surviving with no retirement ill probably die while still working as an old man im a pitiful 35 year old man and i just wanted to let everyone know i dont have any reason to move forward and even if i did id never follow through with it anyway edit to everyone young reading this just try to promise me youll at least go to school and get a degree not to impress anyone like most egomaniacs but just so you have a good job and can get your own place and be proud of yourself you dont want to end up like be i promise you that,1
im actually having a panic attack i decided to look at my grades and im missing around 70 of all assignments that these teachers know damn well takes longer to do than what their class time provides after i was like okay you can do this i get emailed from one of my teachers reminding me i will fail if i dont do something,1

thinking about getting a puppy dogface i was fine for a long time but recently my depression has come back and in full swing including suicidal ideation im thinking about getting a puppy soon personally a healthy correctly bred toy chihuahua that i can dress up and take care of and take with everywhere and be my baby lol rollingonthefloorlaughing it sounds corny but the thought of having an animal that loves you unconditionally and needs you seems like a good emotional support ive had dogs in the past and they were such a great positive influence yall have pets that you love helps get you through the day i know it may not work for everyone but manshrugging,1
need better coping mechanisms for stress whenever i am working on homework and it just isnt making sense or is to hard i get really stressed and frustrated i am a stress crier so when this happens i just start sobbing or i get really angry i have a collection of bad pencils that i snap in half it is really annoying because it basically incapacitates me for an hour and drains all motivation i had to continue working this seems really unhealthy and i would love any advice for coping mechanisms i can use to stop this from happening thanks,1
bought a gun with my stimulus for suicide posting some ramblings here because i feel alone its long and i apologise for the length dont know where to start but currently im in airbnbs using what little savings i have trying not to think about commiting suicide i used my stimulus check to purchase a firearm just for the peace of mind of knowing i could do it whenever i was ready and when i realized how calm that made me i decided to post here to see if anyone could give me some advice i live in the desert in arizona but i grew up in california ive always felt alone and suicidal since a child i was raised by my grandparents as far back as i can remember after my mother left to az after my half brother was born years later my half sister was born there after my grandparents passed when i was 16 i had to move to az ive learned growing up i was around dangerous settings and car accidents in infancy and im worried that also might be a factor in why my brain is wired this way on top of the regular stuff my grandparents were absolutely loving and seemed to try their best to put me in a better environment i never told them these feelings because i wanted to be a perfect son for them in exchange for what they did for me my grandpa was an old school cowboy type traditional conservativebut never once told me i had to be any certain way as you can probably tell polar opposite here in azi have no relationship with my birth father or an idea of what he even looks like yes no photos anyways i was told by my parents that my father went to jail for murdering his girlfriend in ca but hes been out for a few years already somehow and my mother and step father are convinced im a murderous sociopath thats going to kill them all one day randomly my step father choked me and my mother and him pretty much told me to go because i make them feel uneasy stepfather kept a loaded gun on him in case he had to shoot me leading to my airbnb situation most days at home i kept to myself in my room but in october i went back to california for 2 weeks when my depression was hitting its peak to see if i had hope or needed closure or something i went back to my hometown and didnt feel any pain i was happy for once i was with my girlfriend who i wanted to take to prom back in ca before i had to move and it feels like ever since i left my life was in limbo i want to go back to live with her but i need to find a job there as well as a cheap apartment and its extremely difficult however she told me shes been wanting to leave home and get someplace for herself as well its honestly the only reason i havent done it yet but deep down i feel like this wont work out i have this sense of abandonment so i default to isolating myself and suffer because since childhood ive told myself over and over no one really cares about you and it still carries with me and still ruins so many of my relationships but whats really making me finally want to go through with it is that i did gig work so ive been getting stimulus and the pua so basically money to just sit around doing nothing i was living at home with my mother so i saved all the money i have the title to my car 2012 nothing crazy no debt no student loans and a 700 credit score i was always the chubby kid but since covid ive lost weight like 60 pounds smoking weed and drinking water i can get girls i lost my virginity and im still absolutely depressed and suicidal i even put off losing weight for so long because i was so scared if i got in shape and hooked up with women wasnt immediately happy no im actually feeling worse because now what i know self care love is important and a good way to fight depression but i lost that weight paid off my car reduced my debts etc the next goal would be to have my own home but thats just adding time to the clock like i did with my weight problem all of this makes me terrified that what my mother and step father say is true and i should just isolate myself or die i have no family when i was living with my grandparents until 16 no one ever came to visit or help and at their funeral there was mostly friends from the neighborhood i dont know aunties cousins uncles or any of that that abandonment feeling was heightened because of this because my grandparents to me my real parents were abandoned by everyone when they were sick and dying it reinforced the idea that this will happen to me too with any relationshipfriendship i have no one really cares i feel like no matter what life will not get better and i wont be happy just on autopilot bouncing between feelings of absolute torment and apathy i dont want to live for decades this way and id much rather die at peace not to mention how in my lifetime id be contributing so much pollution and waste to the world for an existence that isnt even appreciative of being alive one other thing is holding me back is that im perfectly healthy and wish i could give all my organs away i know they have to be on ice but i was planning on shooting myself deep in the mountains at sunset to let my body be given back to nature but my kidneys could help save a childs life so it feels like a waste and insult im also very scared of dying and there being a hell and eternal punishment i was never really religious but my grandma tried to raise me catholic and that fear is still always there with age my thoughts of suicide went from i hate myself and want to die to i feel nothing and things would be easier for me and them if i was never born i dont keep ammo with me because now i feel like that peaceful mountain death is the only thing keeping me going and as soon i get some ammo im going on that drive,1
what would happen when i commit suicide like when i survive can anyone tell me what will happen i never tried really tried before and i dont plan it this year thanks,1
does anyone elses depression keep them up at night im jealous of the people that are able to sleep away i feel the constant stress of being depressed keeps me up till i get really exhausted i wish there was something to relieve that stress i want to go to sleep but im so depressed my brain wont let me,1

is disassociation depression or something else when my stress gets bumped up to 1110 i tend to disassociate a lot ill read comicsbooks listen to music get lost in my own head or maybe even dive into food or another to me addictive source of dopamine overall just losing my touch with reality its like intentionally trying to put blinders on im trying to stay in reality because in this case my stress is caused by my long distance fiance getting a job near me and moving her and myself into an apartment one element of this is that her family is very much a planning one my family is very much of a get it done asap type deal whereas she wants a three week process id rather just get it done sorry sidetracked my question is if disassociating while stressed is a symptom of my depression or another issue i need to address either way other than a generic practice mindfulness what is something i can do with a busy schedule to remain in touch with myself,1
managing stress i made a post on this sub reddit saying how unhappy and stressed out i was im glad to report that im feeling a little bit better now do to walking i have been walking four miles everyday for the past week at a park and while i havent lost that much weight i feel like i have more energy sleep better and it helps my self esteem a little bit i walk alone and it helps that i can go at my own pace,1
found a potential life partner and i couldnt be happier i met this girl on hinge she and i instantly hit it off and had long conversations over text after a few days i suggested a meetup to continue our conversation in person and she agreed we met ate some food and walked through a park while sharing our lives to eachother the next date didnt go as well she was in a different state and it was virtual i wasnt in the right mindspace and it felt awkward throughout the whole thing i thought i had ruined it she even picked up on it and suggested we dont date anymore but wanted to stay friends and maybe meet up after she got back a few weeks later conversation continued and we met up again just to hang out and have fun doing something together flirting popped back up between us and it felt like sparks were flying so at the end of the day i asked if she wanted to try again she was hesitant and said shed let me know a few months later were still dating staying over at each others houses having 10 hour phone calls and more recently have been recording ourselves reciting books poems and short stories for the other to fall asleep to when we cant be together or on the phone this is the first time in a long time ive been this happy with someone else and i really hope she becomes my forever partner 3,0

i cant remember being happy this past year has been the worst of my life i have no interests i want nothing i have no goals i barely exist at this point i cant stop smoking weed and my grades have dropped im on lexapro and lamictal currently but i still have no motivation and am completely detached from life i just feel constantly empty and the boredom is painful everything is meaningless why bother i want to change the way i look at life to allow myself to have a goal to work towards and not give up on is this even possible is anyone actually happy i need help i want to feel normal again,1
whats the difference between getting out of my comfort zone and stressing myself out i recently transferred from a technical school to a university a lot of people have told me to get involved i dont know a lot of people here and im pretty shy i joined one organization last semester and tried adding another one this semester i thought it would help me build my resume and gain some experience but it just completely stresses me out i wanted to get out of my comfort zone a bit but its beyond stressful and i cant manage it with my other organization school and work am i being too hard on myself and making excuses or should i take a step back before i burn myself out,1
i feel extreme social anxiety after disclosing to my friends that i had severe depression i think the title is pretty self explanatory but basically i was struggling with feelings of depression for a really long time and i just feel as though my social life was better when i kept everything under wraps now that people know i feel like more nervous around others especially because i feel judged by others some of that is real judgement while some of that could be imagined judgement i really just dont know how to interact with people anymore and have lost sight of who i am and what i enjoy now i really just feel lonely again and it is really negatively contributing to my overall mental health i really dont know what to do and just wish i had a clean slate again,1
everyday is painful it never gets better i try so hard to do better but it wont ever get better i just want the pain to go away,1

cooked for myself for the first time i feel so accomplished right now 25f so i have never been so enthusiastic to cook in the past and also didnt have anyone to truly show me my dad was always working so i have always been buying premade foods or making simple stuff like grilled cheese that was around the house for a long time i have always wanted to try to cook but i have always been so intimated by recipes and feeling like i can never cook that or this so i decided the other day i wanted to start simple nothing crazy like a four course meal that would be served at a 5 star restaurant with a complicated recipe so i decided i wanted to try and cook roasted root veggies it just sounded so good plus also a healthy snacklunch to bring to work with me 3 it isnt perfect but i am so proud of what i made all by myself 3 ingredients used gold potatoes zucchini baby carrots mushrooms cut all into 1 inch sizes and mixed with extra virgin olive oil with a little bit of salt pepper and italian seasoning i really wanted to share i dont have many people in my life to talk about this accomplishment i made today i am so happy i cant stop smiling i am so proud of myself and i proved to myself that i can do this when i make it so i know this isnt the most crazy and extravagant recipe and it may not mean anything to anyone besides myself but i am so proud of myself that i did this today and i wont lie i am a little emotional because i never thought i could do something like this i am just so proud of myself all together and want to keep going sorry if this is long but i wanted to share it tastes so yummy and i cant wait to make this again and maybe try other versions 3 3 so proud of myself,0

high school and college students experiencing stress whats your perspective on managing stress im working at a startup that is focusing on solving mental and emotional wellness for high school and college students im hoping to learn more about what would help motivate students to intentionally form habits of mentalemotional self care what do you do today and what would make you want to do more a little about why one in three students experience a significant mental health issue when theyre in school mental and emotional wellness skills arent taught in school and many home environments are not conducive to healthy stress management we want to help equip teenagers with the skills they need to improve their self awareness and resilience,1
people that arent depressed exist and its fuckin insane to me like i posted on askreddit asking nondepressed people how they felt and im shocked not sure what i expected though you exist in this hellhole and youre just like chill with it like im so happy for these people but its mindblowing like i have never known a time that i didnt experience severe recurring depression so its just fuckin crazy that these people are real one even said they dont understand how people can be depressed for seemingly no reason like i wish so much i could say the same like logically i knew they must exist but its still just unfathomable in my mind it kinda makes me sad that i dont understand them just as much as they dont understand me but im glad at least someone is happy in life idk man,1
im so tired i thought when school reopened and normal learning would commence id be ok that id be away from my family and i wouldnt feel so horrible all the time that was a fucking lie because apparently school is overwhelming as fuck too i cant hold a conversation without overthinking i embarrass myself and act weird and this sounds stupid as fuck but im terrified of the boys in my class theyre not dangerous or any of that theyre just so loud i wonder how they can retain so much life inside of them i cant do it the cycle the heaviness both physical and mental my demanding studies i guess my next plan is to get into a good university and keep up my academics so i can get a job and move out theres this kind of prize ceremony at my school where you can win scholarships but i dont know if i should try because i wouldnt know what to do with myself if i failed to secure a good future for myself i mean im still freshman so i shouldnt put to much emphasis into my future as of yet i still have time but i feel like ive been thrown in for a loop because i dont even think ill make it past graduation age alive i have to get up my bag is so heavy with the textbooks my body hurts from all the cuts and bandages are such a nuisance my parents are so overwhelming and scary im not even that smart of a person i made the choice of joining this un council type thing as an after school program i thought itd look good on college applications but im a very shy and withdrawn person and ive realized im probably going to get my ass kicked in any debate the other students in the council are so much more clear with their words more accomplished and brilliant than i am i dont stand next to them at all i thought this last year sucked ass i dont know what im going to do about this one thanks for listening to my rant if youve read this far i bid you a good day,1
just want to talk to someone im 21f and ive been having anxiety attacks since the start of march i know where the attacks come from but i dont know how to deal with it so basically im almost a nurse but my internship is not content with me for over the past 20 weeks i have to re do my internship next year what will cost me another 40 weeks im very pissed about it and i cant have peace with it i just need someone who i can talk to,1
isnt it amazing that everyone whos never had depression or lives an extremely happy and successful life tries to tell you how to cure depression its always some great 1 off line that they think is the secret to fixing everything just love yourself sure let me just go do that real quick you have so much more time things will get better lot more time for things to get worse too youd be disappointing your family etc ah yes by trapping me in the hypothetical mental state of permanently worrying about others over myself i now get to live a happy and successful life thank you really appreciate it thank you,1
my friend attempted suicide a couple days ago my family is saying i will ruin christmas if i spend time with her in the hospital on christmas eve instead of visiting them what can i do a good friend of mine with whom ive been attending therapy for bpd overdosed a couple days ago she survived and was transported unconscious to the hospital she woke up but is unsurprisingly devastated i want to be there as her support she has a boyfriend but no family members who care about her and few friends i had plans to see my family for christmas but when this happened it left me deeply depressed particularly because another good friend of mine had committed suicide four years ago almost on the same day to elaborate i dont like spending christmas with my family i like them but christmas has always been more about chores and preparations than about quiet and peace i thought i would spend christmas by visiting my friend in the hospital i dont want her to be alone i know that if i were in her situation i would appreciate it if someone came to visit me so i proposed this to my mother and brother even the possibility that i would spend the afternoon with her and then go down to see them before dinner however their comments left gasping for air they showed little empathy for my friend or me my mother asked me if i had any normal friends my brother told me that while its ultimately my choice i would be ruining christmas by not coming down or even by coming down just for dinner that everyone would be disappointed in me and it would create arguments implying i would be at fault for them heres the breakdown with my family i risk being ostracized for weeks if not months if i dont go down there however ive felt more and more like they were less and less my family while ive felt like my friends have shown more compassion and empathy for my depression and bpd than my family ever has in fact theyve dismissed it as me not having enough social activity as not having enough will and have called my therapy a waste of time i feel like visiting my friend is the right thing to do i know i will think of her the whole time i would be down at my familys but i do not want to be ostrasized for months i dont think i could handle it with my mental condition any and all thoughts are welcome thank you,1
we lost our baby my fianc and i just spent the better part of this week in the hospital after our son was born stillborn at 20 weeks i had been doing so well before this i take my medicines i work im working towards a degree but now i look around and i dont see the point if i didnt have to take care of her i genuinely think i would kill myself im not religious so i dont care about any of that i just truly dont think i was meant to deal with the things the universe throws my way how do i even begin to get back to my already fucked up level of normal,1
do you ever lay there in the dark just staring into the nothingness and then 5 hours went by somehow and you cant remember if you fell asleep or not this has happened to me twice this week i think im dying,1
i just want to vanish and be forgotten for the rest of eternity if there was button to erase all traces of my existence including being in peoples memories i would have smack the shit out of that,1
it burns to live lost confused tired no motivation mentally drained physically weak no reason to live nothing to look forward to comfort in sadness no place in society family expectations loneliness future i dont want to be a part of this world i dont want to be helped i just want to die why is it so hard to just die why couldnt i have no one around me so i could just easily die without devastating their lives the only possible thing that would bring me relief is death but i cant do it because of my family instead im forced to struggle to do what billions do without breaking a sweat like taking care of their hygiene and being sociable if this isnt an infernal hell then what is if only i could stop thinking about what will happen after and just end this constant torture of consciousness,1
so grateful for my partners support and love i have always been obsessed with the idea of feeling at home and have struggled to truly find it i was neglected as a child making it feel like there was no safe place for me to escape and relax to and ive been living on my own moving from place to place for the past few years and nothing has felt right its always felt so temporary and like im just waiting and hoping the next place fulfils that void i am moving again midmonth so im crashing at my boyfriends place for two weeks and he has made it his mission to make his space feel like a home for me because he knows how much it means to me he has been cleaning organizing and prepping his room for my stay and im just so grateful for how much hes doing for me he even said that i could make a small garden in his backyard because he knows how much ive always wanted one of my own and since ive been apartment living ive never been able to have one myself ive never felt this loved before nor experienced someone making me feel so happy and grateful for their existence,0
whining about my past and current state i really dont know what to write but i somehow have to get this off my chest might be a bit of rambling but ive got nobody to actually talk to also sorry for some mistakes german fellow here okay so a little background story basically since im 1213 im 22 now im suffering from mental problems mostly depression at a time it was also severe social anxiety ive been in a hospital for it for around 2 months i got into it because i admitted to contemplating suicide but basically after getting out it didnt really get better why all of that well my parents divorced at a young age my back then stepdad was an asshole nothing was more important to him than his house car and work hes my little brothers dad and i guess i dont need to tell you that my big brother and i werent of big interest for him we had this big ass house but nothing was getting done he was never home me and my brother went to school my little brother was a baby my mom was also working and i had to see her burning out more and more then she divorced him after getting back the strength and i got sucked into a lawsuit he took my little brother and didnt bring him back so court appointments youth welfare office appraisers all being at home wanting to speak to me as well my back then stepdad said that my mother was not able to keep kids if this wasnt enough my big brother and i also never really had the best relationship since his dad never cared about him and he saw how my dad cared about me but my dad also is someone whos suffering from some kind of anxiety and maybe i learned from it upsidedownface however school was never better i was basically always bullied cant remember a time in school this wasnt the case until the last year and thats it i got to know a beautiful girl apparently i caught her eye and she reached out to me three years of a almost perfect relationship before that i only had a guy who sexually took advantage of me it really was a long time i havent been that happy she was beautiful she was smart funny and so on but in the end she left me for another dude this was two years ago and im still suffering from it not that i want back i just cant start anything new so lets add trust issues to the list but thats not just because of this after it i tried dating other people but in the end it was them fucking others while being with me trying to get their ex bfs jealous or other stuff like that i kinda got into that spiral of just having meaningless sex with dudes or girls i found on grindr or tinder also i never got to out me and i really regret that but that was a big problem because i realized how superficial a lot of people are i wouldnt say im ugly im really not actually from most people i get compliments you are so beautiful or the best friend of my ex said everytime you see toni hes getting hotter i started working out lost some weight and it was good until covid happened and i had to stop it got me into a spiral again i cant get out i hate my body again i gained weight i hate looking in the mirror in general i just dont like what i see now i wanted to start training again but of course i fell while biking and now my hand hurts its like whenever something seems to get better some higher entity is like you thought haha what about friends you ask never really had them i met some really cool people when i was with my girlfriend i thought when she broke up they all told me toni we want this friendships to last dont worry just to abandon me and never hearing of them again after a few months even after i reached out multiple times and now well i wanted to start over again moved from my hometown to a new city got into university new city new opportunities new friends well covid was like nope everything was online it seems like im too dumb for what im doing im still only sitting at home wasted another summer and i just wonder will it ever stop will it ever get better slowly im thinking it will never get better that every high will just be followed by another down that will tear down everything ive built up so far you got money well heres youre washing machine broken finally got a person you like well they fuck someone else finally took the step to a better life well ill do everything that it will be the same in the end finally happy with your body and took the step to go to the gym well gyms are closed now lost 10kg of weight well youll hate yourself either way dont you gyms are open again well fucking fall while biking hurt your hand and and damage your bike so you cant even bike anymore because youve got no money to repair it and lets face it you need money for a new pc first because yours is broken and you need one for university you need new clothes at least a

of that at that age maybe i just cant get enough i really dont know thanks for reading tho dont know if anyone got some advice or ideas what i can do hope this wasnt too much but i really have to get

people stressed me by tolding me to stop being stressed how to deal with stress today i was easily stressed and angry when i was a kid each time it happens my family give me little sentence like calm yourself why are you stressing over x im not stressed for x why are you angry am i angry no so you shouldnt be angry you will have health issues if you continue to be stressed you will have issue in your work if you are angry they never try to resolve the reason why i was stressed or angrythats another issue only to fix the stress in a condescending way and all their little phrases increased my stress and my anger exponentially today im a 35 adult women and fortunately no one including those who previously do dont say this to me anymore some of them even admit to me they used those to increase my angry for fun at this time and that they are sorry for that i knew that but it didnt help the issue is today each time im stressed or angry i still hear those advice in my head its still stress me even more angryme even more and can make me cry that happen no matter what was the original stress was about i can cry because my bus is late because it will trigger some memory like the time i was told i shouldnt be angry for missing a bus because it was my fault of missing the bus but i can support the pression of talking in front of 400 persons for 1 hour because it wont trigger any old memory its also hard to explain to other why i am such a stress mess sometime but able to support a lot othertime consequently somepeople think im faking my stress any idea how to deal with stress when the simple fact of stress dealing trigger some old trauma,1

what is it called when someone is so stressed they snap at the first thing that draws their attention last night i was cooking dinner for my gf while she was setting up a sprinkler in the front yard she had been out there by herself for several minutes while i was working in the kitchen not knowing that the following factors were causing her to become stressed a weak hose that kept kinking so water wouldnt flow through it the three neighbors dogs barking at her through the fence they were within three feet of her and trying to connect two hoses that did not want to fit when i finished getting dinner ready i happily went outside to let her know dinner was ready up to this point we had been having a lovely evening and i never suspected anything was wrong so my mental and emotional defenses were down and i was not expecting anything after i told her dinner was ready i stood waiting for some response while keeping our dog busy mowing she might get in my gfs way she turned around a yelledyou dont have to rush me and went back to doing what she was working on clearly angry i had no response and could only stammer that i wasnt rushing her and finally gave up and went inside and sat on the couch to figure out what had just happened this isnt the first time she has snapped at me when i am not the source of stress on her but after the inevitable argument and makeup she told me how she had been stressed by all the things i had listed and believed i had come out to hurry her along to dinner she is seeing a therapist now for about a year but only once a month but i think she should be seeing them about twice a month but she always has excuses why she cant so i want to know how i can avoid her snapping at me like that again in the future how do i keep her from getting stressed out by ordinary as i see them things,1

our conscious awareness is one of our most powerful tool in this life being in full control of it opens us up to receive the infinite cosmic energy from the universe did he just say infinite yes and you can see how this energy truly is by noticing how every second we get a new opportunity to change our state of being point of view and mental state child hood traumas events that happened or even words that were said a long time ago can hurt and carry through into our adulthood robbing us of our aliveness and spontaneity there is a tendency to store the energy of an unresolved trauma by locking it in the body even if the situation happened only once an unreleased and unresolved trauma can become trapped within the body and its energy field causing tension stress and possibly disease releasing this stored suppressed or blocked energy is a healthy natural process that allows a person to resolve issues and to become more alive one simple method to release this energy is by clearing it from your meridians channels through which flows energyspiritual chills euphoria voluntary goosebumps ecstasy prana chi qi vayus aura mana life force pit rapture ruah ether nephesch chills goosebumps the force if you are interested into doing this free and simple method heres a youtube video for you and heres my reddit community rspiritualchills where you can share your own experiences talk and ask questions about your spiritual energy,0

when you reach that point where whats wrong no longer has an answer when theres no longer any specific thing that you can pinpoint as the reason youre feeling the way you do when you dont even fully understand it yourself why cant you just be happy if nothing specific happened to ruin your mood when youre so used to feeling depressed that you dont even know how to feel happy during the moments that are supposed to make you happy when the few things you had in life that you used to enjoy either become dull to you or impossible to motivate yourself to do when it starts to seem pointless to even try accomplishing anything because you know that no matter where you are in life you will probably still be depressed when you can no longer stand speaking to the people you love because its either pretend to be happy or ruin their whole moodday and make them worried about you when even the most simple conversations are very hard to get through without being triggered by something and wanting to break down when it gets to the point where you have heavily considered abruptly cutting the people you love out of your life because interacting with them is becoming exhausting and you would rather them think youre an asshole for isolating from them than to give them the even more painful truth about where your mind is going and what you think is inevitable when the overall feeling of not having anything in your life that makes you happy anymore starts to be far more painful in your mind than actually having negative things happen to you how do you even answer whats wrong when its both not anything and every single aspect of your life at the same time edit i was not expecting so many people to see and relate to this post but i guess these feelings are more common than any of us thought as much as i hate that other people are going through the same thing reading these replies did make me feel a little more understood and a little less alone so thank you all for that,1
i dont want to die i just want to cease to exist,1
my pain 25f is overwhelming ive been quarantining in an abusive household for the last year and am in need of some kind words ive been struggling a lot this week my mental health has always been shit but lately its just gotten worse i recently fired my therapist because my insurance changed and she wasnt accepting the new provider she wasnt a good fit for me either but something is better than nothing so aside from my boyfriend and a few friends i dont have anyone i can rely on i feel bad venting to the people around me because theyre all going through tough times too and it just doesnt feel fair for me to unload on them so i hope that opening up to this sub is the right idea even though i still feel guilty expressing my pain the heart of it all is that i have cptsd along with other psych disorders and these past few weeks ive been drifting in and out of disassociation flashbacks and episodes of crying fits i cant stop reliving my trauma and am having a tough time with positive selftalk right now id say my selfworth and selfesteem are at a 0 it doesnt help that i live in an abusive household but unfortunately i dont have anywhere else to go and this is something ive dealt with my whole life my mother is neglectful and my father is emotionally verbally and sometimes physically abusive he picked a fight with me this morning for no reason and it set me over the edge so between the flashbacks disassociation and deeply painful depression i just feel so unsafe in my house if my parents see me crying theyll either gaslight or bully me i just wish things were different i dont really know where im going with this post other than it would be nice to be reminded that not everyone is mean and nasty that i am a good person and i deserve a good life i just want to stop crying edit thank you for the wholesome the silver and the hugz loudlycryingface loudlycryingface loudlycryingface i did not expect this post to get any attention let alone receive my first reddit awards im crying tears of joy and hope now thank you kind internet strangers i will be sure to pay it forward 3 edit 2 wow this outpouring of support was so not expected im trying to respond to everyone but its taking longer than expected so in the case that i missed your comment thank you,1
im going apartment hunting this saturday afternoon and then going on a first date with a guy ive liked for a really long time this saturday im 23 fgoing to go with my friend lindsey to look at apartments were thinking of moving in together and its really exciting to be taking that final step out of my parents house i love them both dearly but its time for me to start another chapter in my life speaking of which im also going on my first date with this guy 27 m ive been crushing on for the last year hes my friend angies brother and i finally worked up the courage to ask him out saturday night when we were just hanging out in a group he seems surprised but genuinely happy and he said yes we got to spend some time together over the long weekend and had our first kiss sunday night weve been texting each other throughout the day all week and talking in the phone in the evenings we both want to try this new taco place that opened up near where i live so were going to go have dinner and maybe a few drinks im really excited about this guy hes really quiet but he seems so sweet and ive thought he was so good looking from the minute i met him so right now im just in a really happy place and i just wanted to share that,0
does depression make you want to breakup my 29f bf 29m has been going on and off about breaking up with me since the last year we have been in a eight year long relationship he was seeking help for depression 34 years ago but he never completed treatment because he started feeling better soon one year ago we hit a rough patch with him doubting things in our relationship and that i did not love him cheated on him because i was not fully honest with him regarding some things which ive apologised for but i never cheated on him he quit his job at the same time and started freelancing for a while only to resume work two months ago in july 2021 before starting this job he did seek professional help not on my insistence but because he said he needed help with sleep he was on lexapro and another medicine for 23 months before he ghosted his psychiatrist saying that the doctor was just ripping him off he has faced major setbacks in his friendships over the last one year he doubts most of his friends and doubts their intentions does not feel happy in general the reason why i think he is depressed is i cannot recall a time when he was genuinely happy about anything maybe apart from when he got this new job but it soon turned into a stressful situation since this is not fulltime employment yet and his performance will be evaluated after he completes 3 months earlier when he would break up with me he would come back every other week saying he does love me and cannot live without me and used to apologise for his behaviour since the past few months his stance has become i never loved you i was wrong to be with you for eight years i am sorry i didnt say this earlier even if i did love you i dont now you must move on i will too we still meet each other on the weekends at times i am helping him out with his gradschool applications building resume sops lors essays and we still do talk on a regular basis its just that he will be awfully moody one day and then get started with his you should move on i dont love you talk i am trying to understand which part is true his depression or his words i have told him for now that we are broken up but the conversation on moving on is something we can have when he is feeling like himself our friends also point out his approach of painting everything in black if anything remotely grey is associated with a thing and they do call him out at times but his recent more fierce stance on saying how he does not love me and never did makes me wonder if i am the one just living in my own thoughts and things werent what i think they were we have spent 8 years together and had every intention of building a future together which even he has talked about at times on multiple occasions in the last one year i am ready to hold on if its just his depression talking i have loved him enough to know i can continue for some more time but i am just not sure if i am right anymore,1

if my depression spiked during the corona virus is it really depression or is it regular before the corona virus came i was suffering from being emotional numb this was because of things outside the virus but would take to long for me to explain however once the corona virus hit my mental health and self care dropped to the floor for me i was in the 7th grade the first time the corona virus was brought up and we went on lockdown during does first 6 months as i had my summer break to i played video games constantly with my friends from the uk as that was where i use to live and i was feeling great at the time because any kid at that age would love to not go to school for 6 months but whilst does months were going by i started realizing how unproductive my daily routine was and how bad my social skills were getting by this time i was in the 8th grade and now we actually had to do online school the only thing is me being in my room 247 for 6 months straight not doing anything but playing games and eating made my numbness way worse at this point i started not caring about life anymore and instead of living it would just feel like im existing in a dead corpse it got so bad that i cheated on every online work i got and i did not feel bad at all and i still dont even when i had to go in person to do my final exams i knew i was gonna fail them but still didnt care now im a freshman in highschool and i honestly cant see myself doing anything but working at a fast food restaurant once i finish school bring abled to make friends has gotten so as to the point where i find it hard to speak to new people online to be honest highschool isnt the worst im glad i get to go in person because its forcing me to speak to people however ive spoke to people about this depression and a lot of people say it is because of covid however i havent seen much people talk about it here in all honesty im hoping that does people are right because ive had this numbness for 2 years now and i dont want it to be something i have to live with forever,1

does anyone else feel like being depressed is just part of them and its something that they will never be able to change about themselves or cure i literally cannot remember a time in my life where i wasnt angry or unhappy with myself or how people treated me ive had body issues since i was 8 years old because my grandparents overfed me and let me eat sweets all day which led to me being outcasted by my peers and constantly criticised by my parents i first started thinking about suicide when i was maybe 12 or 13 and 10 years later i still think about it i dont think ive ever has a solid year of my life where ive thought that everything was going to be okay and life was worth living ive had months of temporary relief from the constant pain but thats all they were temporary i thought finding someone to spend my life with and who loves me unconditionally and puts up with my suicidal tantrums would fix me but it hasnt i thought effectively curing my disfiguring autoimmune disease would help me have a new lease on life but it hasnt i have lots of friends an attractive face and i had a job i liked no body in my personal life except for two people know that i struggle and the rest would never guess it i have nothing to be sad about really i have an objectively easy life but that doesnt matter i am depressed and i always will be i could have the perfect body my dream job have millions in my bank account and id still feel exhausted in the same way that people say once an addict always an addict ive come to believe the same thing about my depression,1
youre faking your depression because you look happy i fucked up my colleaguesfriends at work asked me in which reddit group i posted the most stuff and i said in rdepression without thinking because my brain is a slow stupid piece of shit so they said just because you get sad sometimes doesnt mean you have depression and a lot of people are faking depression nowadays while they both suspiciously looked at me as if im some kind of murderer at work im super bubbly and happy and it is fucking exhausting after they said all that i became too awkward to reply so i walked away hid myself in the back and started acting like myself again i just sat on the ground for a bit did nothing felt like shit but also emotionless like im floating empty alone and misunderstood im definitely not faking my depression and it freaking hurts when people dont believe you because you seem happy i automatically become fake happy at work or with friends even though i despise being like that faking and socializing takes up a lot of freaking energy so when im finally home im just dead in my bed im not positive or bubbly im a negative piece of shit who cant even leave her bed most of the time or brush her teeth everyday a shitty past and a shitty present and had a burn out and no support and so on yay super happy ps sorry i swear quite a lot when im upset edit just wanted to say thank you for all the support kind comments and my first award c,1
everytime i leave my room i am overwhelmed by my family i am 20 and trying to move out when i get the money i live with my mum and my younger sister whos 16 they dont tidy up after themselves and i consider myself someone who has to have things tidy to feel normal its got to the point where every single time i go downstairs its a mess and i either end up shouting and getting angry or crying i cant cope with having to constantly clean up after them and i know if i just stop itll build up and be messy nobody helps me just needed to vent because idk what advice to receive,1
how do i tell her i recently told my mum that im depressed while shes very caring she has not read up on depression and recognises it only as the big sad to her there must be a reason to be depressed much like when people are sad about something and while im sure many of us do i cant pinpoint a single reason for me feeling this way she shows plenty concern but her remarks like dont feel sad okay i love you and the whole family loves you annoys me slightly mainly because she also makes comments like you seem perfectly normal to me idk man ive seen so many people say that shit and when the person finally takes their life they regret not acting on what the person told them in any case could someone advice me on how i should tell her to either educate herself or explain to her that depression doesnt need a reason i had previously told her upfront that depression is an illness and i dont know why i feel sad guess shes not satisfied with that explanation then i told her to stop saying such things like i seem perfectly fine and read up on depression guess she hasnt done that either advice anyone,1
how to be happy instead of miserable when you become 60 millions of us call happiness their lifelong goal but few define what happiness means often leading us to chase what our parents friends and role models defined as happiness so when we are back to wearing diapers we realize we ignored everything we genuinely esteemed in my experience studying dozens of happiness frameworks and sciencebacked studies about happiness ive found the best chance at being happy at any time comes from defining what happiness isnt its like an inverse happiness checklist in it you write what doesnt bring you joy and then ensure your current pursuit of happiness whether it is to travel the world or become wealthy doesnt include any of the items from the checklist the inverse checklist serves two purposes it helps define happiness and tells you which activities to remove from your life so for example if you conclude money doesnt bring joy but you work from 99 because hustle is life then reduce the number of say side projects you have otherwise youll be frustrated after reaching financial freedom and likely feelphysically and mentally exhausted each persons definition of happiness varies however most people can include specific items into their inverse checklist to define happiness your definition of happiness cannot reject distress we cant control the decisions and behaviors of humans animals or nature otherwise hurricanes and phone thieves wouldnt exist so no matter the statistical formula you use to predict events or the number of possible scenarios you draw on your whiteboard potential sources of unhappiness are always around the corner to avoid the discomfort from harmful events some people write a list of sources of distress and eliminate them from their life for example they quit their job to run from their nerveracking boss or switch majors the issue with this list is its potential sizeits infinite because any event in our lives can distress us a more efficient solution is to invite distress into your life and realizing happiness can coexist with events that dont match our definition of a perfect activity day or life for example a harmless event like microsoft word crashing before letting you save an article could either ruin your day or it could become a fun challenge to overcome when you welcome distress you experience two benefits first you become used to different causes of discomfort reducing their chances of affecting you second you realize distress can and must coexist with happiness your definition of happiness cannot come from others most of us chase a definition of happiness that other people set for us leading to repentance during our deathbed for example some people accumulate academic titles to impress their parents while others seek minimalism according to a monks advice in college psychologists doctors and nurses taught me around 80 of older people underpalliative careregretted their lives choices but you dont need wrinkles or to be in a hospital to regret your life so instead change it today first write down a list of scenarios that would bring happiness to your life you can then describe the benefits of each scenario and the barriers between you and them second answer the most crucial question whos someone in my life who believes this scenario would bring happiness ask yourself one last question is this goal worth pursuing even though x person shares it contrast your answer with other items from your checklist so if you think happiness is living amongst your friends in the countryside goal your friends feel the same influence but your inverse checklist says youdontlike being away from the city then stop pursuing that goal avoid being miserable on your deathbed while your dna differs from the millions of people who have regretted their lifes choices on their deathbeds you may be following another persons definition of happinessjust like they did unfortunately the old and sick dont have the strength to change their lives drastically but you do so start developing today a definition of happiness your elderly self will accept oneyoutruly believe share one item you would add to your inverse happiness checklist below if you are not comfortable doing it publicly please dm me on twitter at mrnicolasforero im curious to discover what you would add,0

i dont know how to get help from mobile please forgive any errors i have been suffering slight depression for years now mostly loneliness and i suppose from the general sense of responsibility i am the sole breadwinner for my parents im doing ok but it always feels like it will never stop i see no plausible way how my life can get better i dont want to go deep into all my issues but thr gist is im doing my job but i am not happy i feel guilty when i feel sad because i have so many good things in my life i feel like i should not be complaining i want to happy but i dont know how to be i wish i could whenever i think about it i feel like the only way i can be at peace is if the whole world just ends i know its a horrible thing to say im not suicidal because that will not solve anything for me i want to take care of my parents im no use to them if im dead i tried getting help with a mental health professional to better cope with whatever im going thru but she rated me as a moderately severe depressed person and said she would send me details to a therapy group but she never did just forgot it just feels like everyone has abandoned me to deal with my problems i want to be able to handle my troubles better myself but it would be so nice to have someone who is willing to help to care i dont know what to do to get rid of this feeling that i will never be happy and the only consolation is that the world may end someday and i dont have to deal with it anymore,1

i hate that it feels like i cant even post on reddit i get anxious about things like people downvoting my posts or saying negative things to me there is a series that has its own odd logic like milk being used to have a characters tooth grow back as i was reminded of nicely i then mentioned how lately in this series a characters skull has become cracked it showed an xray type of shot of it and everything and i asked if milk would be enough to heal this characters cracked skull this time and someone responded to me with oh so youre a shit poster then or just stupid i dont know if its because of my autism or because of me or what but i sometimes get told negative things on the internet by others and it really brings me down a lot,1
burst into tears because of animal crossing ive been having a really rough few months and my depressions been more intense than usual so i got animal crossing 2 weeks ago in hopes of it calming me down when it gets bad a new villager just moved onto my island and it started singing while staring at the lake i started crying because it was just so pure and cute that it made me realize how fucking depressed i am social distancing being quarantined not seeing my friends becoming recently single on top of my mental illnesses have been so overwhelming im so tired of being alive and i wish these feelings would just stop,1
so many people have told me that they care and that i need to keep them in my life i live across the ocean from my home country and its very isolating i always felt so alone recently i have come to my country and visiting aunts cousins siblings that i have no contact with and they all tell me to not exclude myself even cousins that i havent had much contact in my life have told me that they want to know how im doing and so and so i never knew they cared about me like this im going through a break up from an abusive relationship and hearing about how they value me as a person makes me happy i dont know how to explain but it really gives me comfort i have been so down before that i had to be hospitalized for a week and i felt that no one cared but i know that its not the truth family is the most important to me and i feel glad that these people want to be apart of my life the support i am receiving and people that are listening to me and understanding my side and telling me that they want the best for me that they know i deserve better is overwhelming great i feel like before people gaslighted the shit out of me saying i was making a big deal out of nothing and things like that to not be laughed at is amazing it feels a lot easier to let go of my traumas with the support i am receiving,0

starting new job so i need to rant a bit here im starting a new job as a ground support officer this week its two twelvehour shifts a week and i dont know how much im getting paid yet they said it 20 an hour which is the same im earning for my temp im taking this job because my temp is giving not me enough hours and i dont want to do building work anymore i know it pays a lot in the long run but its too far away from my friends and family and i want to do my own thing not just be my dad because i see how stressed and angry he is and i dont want to be like that i hope i can get either get 25 an hour or an extra shift im struggling to have to pay for gas and rent gas each week with my current job this new is closer but i still not sure what im doing i also had to sign up with a course and a test and also drug and alcohol test which cost me 205 dollars also i know some people might say go work and mcdonalds or something well i cant i have already applied in the past and have been turned i also have very little retail experience,1
miniburnouts hi im dealing with a hardtograsp psychological problem the pattern is somewhat like this im always highly stimulated sometimes im tempted to work too hard and end up in some sort of miniburnout this happens about once a week and leaves me foggy and unmotivated dopaminedepleted for about 2 days i have a lot of atypical adaptations built in that are related to this when im overly excited it inhibits me probably the same way that anxious people are inhibited but i dont feel any anxiety im often hardly aware of how stimulated i am sometimes i am somehow compelled to go into super sayan mode work my ass off try to complete my whole todo list in one daythis pretty much instantly triggers a miniburnout this also happens when i drink just one cup of coffee except when im socially active then i can take all the stimulants i want and be fine weird this state has gone on for about 2 years and i still havent been able to make sense of it maybe theres a blindspot somewhere anyway other than perhaps someone being able to label this thing for me i have a question about a specific solution i have in mind my defense mechanism for high stress is usually to tone it down through reframing my situation as easy meditating ignoring my todo list etc now i have a suspicion that this miniburnout is emotional or motivational in nature that im not actually chemically depleted but that theres a ton of emotional baggage that needs to be cleared each time that i go down or alternatively that im just fed up with how little progress im making given the effort i put in if this is true it requires a whole different approach it would involve not changing the arousal but the valence of my emotions reframing my high stress as excitement instead of anxiety maybe that will make the stress less chronic but im afraid that this will just put me further in the wrong place because it will involve kicking down habits that reduce arousal thereby increasing it and that would be extremely highcost for ive been in a very very bad place as a result of burnout could anyone shine their light on this any progress on this problem would be major for me thank you,1

i wish i could give my life to someone who actually wants to live fuck new years by the way,1
im so caught up in my web of depression that i sometimes forget that there are people out there who are content with their lives and want to keep living it just seems so strange to me that most people dont spend every waking moment hating themselves and thinking about death like while theyre waiting for the train what do they think about if not jumping on the tracks and ending it right there or seeing a building and wondering if the impact of jumping from it will be enough to kill them do they just look at a tree with strong branches and think what a nice tree that is instead of which branch would be best to hang myself from how is it possible that some people just dont want to die not to mention so many people who go through painful and expensive treatments just to stay alive it makes me feel so guilty for all the times ive wished to get cancer so i can die without having to do anything i wish i could donate my physical health to someone who needs it so i can just let my sick brain shrivel up and die,1

i have a friend who is talking about self harm i need to know what to do to help them hey reddit i was told here would be a good place to post this as i said in the title i have this friend who is talking about self harm and i dont know what to do he told me yesterday that i honestly dont know what im doing but i might not see you tommorow or the day after that or ever but if i do anything drastic dont know if i will just know its better for the world and the people around me this was the only mention of suicide that he has told me directly but he has also made a lot of self harm jokes and vented about how much of a failure and disappointment he thinks he is he says he hasnt eaten or slept in four days i dont know how i can help them i just cant handle both my emotions and trying to help him work through his some added info hes a trans man hasnt come out yet in a family that is very likely not to accept him he also told me a trans girl he loved me and i told him i only liked him as a friend i know if i told them i loved them then that would probably help them but i dont want to lie he hasnt mentioned anything about him harming himself because i only like him so i dont think hes manipulating me as one person suggested we are both still living with our families and so trying to get someone like a therapist is a bit harder sorry if this came out weird i am just terrified for their safety and i cant think straight,1

darkest before the dawn right struggling with stress for 2 months now coaching sessions only focus on the thoughts and how to take control of my wandering mind and all the overwhelming thoughts that keep piling up but what im now facing is a whole different kind of monster the physical reactions and symptoms now with dizziness constant headache from tension in neck and shoulders and the dark and gloomy thoughts of all the possible complications and deceases that may follow a period of stress illness my mood is around 0 and all my thoughts are on the above when i force myself to do other stuff like briefly play with my kids or focus on a cup of coffee i feel a bit more relaxed but as soon as my mind is not actively focused on something else i slip back into darkness basically i am just writing this hoping that someone can reassure me that others have felt the same and got better or maybe share some things that have helped others progress and move past it into brighter times,1

not sure what to do so a little background first this isnt my main reddit account and the name is coincidental but accurate second ive suffered from pretty extreme anxiety for pretty much my whole life but its only really been the last 23 years ive suffered from the kind of symptoms you would generally associate with bad depression and the last week has sent me over the edge in both regards im falling behind in college even though its a subject i should and do love i feel my a few of my teachers are complete assholes and events in my life during the last week have really put me down between all that im honestly having a panic attack right now about class this morning to be honest the events of the last week turned my depression into the realm of suicide ideation i hate to say that but i have thought about it i had to take my father to the hospital and i didnt know if he was going to come back and then my mother found stuff which didnt paint him in a great light ive felt like complete crap ever since im calling a doctor today after class today and im going to get help i dont want to live like this and i cant i cant keep feeling the way i do because i know it is a path to selfdestruction and i dont know if its me specifically or the rest of the world or a combination all i know is i need help i cant do it myself i hate asking for help but i need it i dunno im not sure what to do i dont have anyone to turn to or talk to sorry for most likely wasting your time i just had to get it off my chest i hope they can help me,1
when is it my turn for people to care about me i feel like my mom has always loved my brothers more she hates talking to me and has always been kinder to them she held them accountable when they were younger made them do their chores get a job whatever obviously this taught them work ethic and self accountability but she seemingly doesnt care to do the same with me i have a few close friends but sometimes i wonder if they actually care or only seem to care because theyre afraid to be mean i feel useless like ill never go anywhere and theres no point in trying i feel stupid im just the dumb kid to laugh at how dumb he is i feel awkward no girl would want anything to do with me because im fucking weird but not even a good goofy weird just weird,1
i feel like a suicide attempt is the only way to make people care i live in a country where depression isnt taken too seriously people just think im going through a hard time or feeling down they dont understand just how serious the circumstances are just to clarify i dont want to commit suicide though i have seriously considered it however i do think that if i made a suicide attempt then peoples perspectives would change i know its an irrational way of thinking but im getting to a point where im running out of options edit did not expect this to blow up thank you to everyone who gave their advicesupport i just want to update that i am currently seeking out professional help,1
why do i miss the comfort of being depressed i used to be depressed 2 years back i have since recovered with the help of lifestyle changes and medication ive realised how fucked up my head was when i was depressed and now i see how much more light there is but there are times that my thoughts wander and i start having those all consuming negative thoughts and suicidal ideation im aware though that im not actually depressed now its like im neither here nor there im never really happy or never really sad and i kind of miss being depressed i miss the comfort of knowing theres nothing truly ahead of me and the inevitable death does this make sense to anyone do you have those types of thoughts as well,1

i am a single mom and i struggle with what to do with my kid on summer breaks well my child is gifted and this year her school created a free summer camp for kids just like her i couldnt be happier every summer i would get so depressed with trying to find some expensive camp to put her in and have to worry about getting her there and picking her up while i worked full time last year she even got kicked out of summer camp but paying for it was so hard and picking her up with stressful this year her school took care of all of that they are offering a free summer camp just for the smart kids and providing transporation i really love the transportation factor because i just got a new job and i have no way of picking her up on time thankfully they have a special bus just for the kids that will pick them up and take her home the bus stop is within few of my doorstep so i dont have to worry about her walking home alone either its really like god answered my prayers this year i stress about summer almost all year and it was great to get a letter that she had been chosen for this special program i think it was partly because covid had a every kid struggling a bit and left a lot of kids unprepared for advanced placement in their next grade level they will be feeding them for free as well another bonus for my pockets i couldnt be happier for her or more excited,1

where does stress come from it is perhaps an accepted fact that stress is usually brought on by outside forces this is so ingrained in most peoples mindsets that the slightest inconvenience or signs of being pushed out of the comfort zones will get some negative reactions from the body and that would be considered stress generally outside forces are blamed for the internal turmoil that stress is supposed to cause where is it when life in general does not unfold the way we perceive it should determines the stress levels we experience for more,1

my 27m dad 58m killed himself and its my fault my dad lived far away and i lived independently after a lot of quarrel with my relatives whom i stayed with for a while long story deserves its own post despite effectively being banished from the rest of the family i was still in good terms with my dad one day he asked for money said it was to start a business there and that id get a share of the income i was struggling with my own career and even financially but i found my way to send the amount he requested anyway i was even jobless too ashamed to admit it when i sent the money a month passed and there was no update on the business i followed up and he said he was busy there was some delay etc even more months passed and there was barely anything i chattedtexted him and he said hell just return the money when he can turns out that he was financially struggling there as well i was able to find employment eventually but i was paranoid i dont have any savings on my own nor any emergency money my sick leaves are unpaid and i will not have income if im sick with covid i kept asking him if he could send even a fraction of that amount i told him that i cant even find workfromhome setups as i cant afford the equipment needed he said he still couldnt send any amount at all i was mad i told him of all the times he told me i shouldve forgiven the family obey them blindly and so on and here we are now in a situation where theyre not even helping him i urged him to just borrow from them theyre well off im not im surviving by own monthly income with barely any savings plus i had to borrow a bit of money to send him which i still have to pay off he kept apologizing said hes trying to find a way i was losing my patience i kept followingup every week or so sometimes months i was also pissed because family already banished me and i feel like im being forced to join this problem i had no reason to mistrust my dad and im sure he genuinely needed help but the clan could help him better than i could one day he texted saying he can pay me back soon the next day i learned that he killed himself i didnt want this to happen i know more context or info is needed so ill edit and comment along the way im still shaken by this,1
as my depression lifted the world seem to change around me i have a story that id like to share i think it pretty accurately reflects how depression shaded my world and how that changed once i started to get better ive been lurking here a while and want to let people know that things can get better i had been in a rut for several years it got to the point where i could barely get out of bed i dont know exactly what changed but i decided that i had had enough and would do what i could to get better for me this took the form of quitting smoking i was up to a pack a day and going out for jogs i was in university at the time there was a lagoon on campus a small lake that was next to the ocean about 15 miles around i decided this would be a good place to try running laps i was awful out of shape could barely breathe and was only able to run for a few minutes at a time without my lungs and legs screaming to stop i was certain i must have looked awful and that everybody was judging me but i kept at it i noticed this woman out there walking laps she was an old woman with nasty hair sagging skin and she wore these horrible flipflops which revealed toe nails that definitely needed clipping what a hag i would think to myself why is she even out here as i started going out there regularly i saw her almost every day eventually i started to wave to her as i would pass the first few times she didnt notice but eventually she would wave back then i started smiling and waving and she would smile and wave back it became a part of my routine to wave and smile at her while out on my runs she was working almost just as hard as i was getting out there every day i was getting close to graduation and this would be my last run around that lagoon so when i saw her that day i stopped and started to talk to her we introduced ourselves she told me that she had lost her husband a few months prior to a heart attack and that she was hoping to get into shape so that she could get healthier and live long enough to see her grandchildren grow up this interaction brought me to the brink of tears the woman looked nothing like when i first saw her she was smiling had a glow of positivity about her and even got herself some proper footwear as i got better the way i saw and interacted with the world also got better i imagine that this womans view of me as an overweight slob who could barely breathe trying to run might have improved as she got better too you are not alone things can get better,1

nobody has ever shown romantic interest in me context i am a 20 year old college student with severe clinical depression and anxiety i have a decent amount of friends and we pretty regularly hang out and go out together my friends say im not an unlikable person i have some hobbies including reading and writing im told im pretty funny and as far as i know my friends and family like having me around however i tend to be more on the introverted side and dont always take to people right away i also dont think im necessarily ugly just not attractive i have a skinny build im 510 etc etc ive gone through two whole decades of my life and not a single person has ever shown a romantic interest in me i have had and currently have plenty of friends who are girls and have never had an issue talking with them so its not like i am someone who never puts themselves out there during quarantine a bunch of friends and i downloaded tinder as a way to talk to people around campus while we stayed shut in our apartmentshomes nothing really came of it but i quickly realized that i wasnt having the same experience as all my other friends they were getting tons of matches and likes and i was only getting a few likesmatches all the conversations i had with matches never seemed to go anywhere despite trying different approaches and even having my friends give me advice when i brought up my lack of likesmatches to my friends they tried overhauling my profile to be more like theirs but there was no change tonight a couple friends and i were hanging out and they were all swiping through tinder and getting matches while discussing their plans with some of these girls to hookuphangout obviously i had nothing to contribute to the conversation and just sat there scrolling through tinder while watching my friend next to me get 3 matches in a row i felt awful im just so tired of it all i wasnt worried in high school about girlsrelationships as i figured id have plenty of chances in college to pursue those things but im coming to realize that people are just not interested in me i feel like ive tried everything and seeing my friends put no effort into any of it and still have so many girls coming to them makes me feel like just giving up im scared because i feel that after i graduate its only going to be that much harder to meet people i guess im just wondering if anyone ishas been in the same boat and if anyone has any advice,1

anxiety depression ptsd from childhood trauma 30 years later any insight appreciated backstory id like to tell my story in hopes someone can offer some insight about where to go from here or assurance that im not alone the pandemic hasnt treated any of us well myself included i had two nonlifealtering events occur about 10 and 7 months back that spun me out with some disproportionately intense anxiety and i started questioning a lot of stuff about my behavior sanity and even intellectual capability for years id been having intrusive thoughts i kept dismissing as just a bad habit or related to stress theyre mostly selfcritical sometimes slightly paranoid in content as the pandemic fell upon us these thoughts got way intense i was shushing myself out loud in front of people sometimes because i couldnt think or listen to the radio or anything without them inundating my mind theyve since calmed down a little over the summer and im pretty scared of going back there i didnt even know they were intrusive thoughts until maybe a month ago i really thought i might have a mental illness or intellectual disability im still very confused about how i feel since i got my vaccine ive felt comfortable going to the drs office and brought up what i thought was anxiety i had a blood test results fine and after some screening questions my dr asked me if i was depressed i didnt think so at the time but my symptoms primarily early morning awakenings rumination the thoughts and not sadness but a discomfort i cant describe more closely match depression than anxiety so ive been given a script for some antidepressants i dont know that im ringing all the bells for depression or anxiety though heres where i need some insight i am extraordinarily uncomfortable discussing with my dr how i feel my voice is shaky and i feel like im fighting back tears with a queasy feeling in my chest i was asked at one point if i experienced childhood trauma while i hadnt considered my childhood traumatic before i knew it wasnt ideal now im looking into childhood trauma and im hitting many points on the list id been threatened with abandonment lived a parent who abused alcohol witnessed domestic violence and it was frequently a hostile environment yelling slamming cabinets and doors and such having a child of my own now im questioning other aspects of my upbringing im a grown man and ive lived with this for 30 years i feel fucked up that im this terrified of how i feel my intrusive thoughts and how emotionally volatile it feels to discuss my feelings with a dr i can maybe see how some of my experiences in childhood are effecting my adult behavior i dont know if pushing it all down again and moving on is a solution is this discomfort something that can be corrected why is this happening now the stress of the pandemic i cant be the only person in their late 30s going bananas and wondering from where this came from right ive started getting help ill try the antidepressants and see if i can stabilize but where do i go from here if you made it here thanks for your time,1

exercise for ppd after a csection that isnt walking i have had depression throughout my adult life i had a baby about 1 week ago and was preemptively diagnosed with ppd during my pregnancy given my mental health history and a fairly rough go of it during pregnancy i am not sure what to do ive tried various ssrisnris but the main side effect for me is excessive drowsiness obviously not doable right now with a newborn and very little sleep im in therapy but ive been bouncing around different therapists for the last 6 years and no one has really helped me at all i think i am in the small subset of people for whom therapy just isnt a good treatment option exercise has been the most helpful for me in the past in managing depression but i absolutely cannot go for a walk for exercise walking is not intense enough and i end up ruminating and feel worse than ever the more i walk the last few weeks of pregnancy my mental health was in the garbage after i was going on lots of walks to try to get labor going im really not sure what i can do to get moving after the csection i dont even think i could do yoga as it requires too much core work walking is just not an option for me with the rumination and intrusive thoughts does anyone have any suggestions of what to do,1
i feel stress every day and apparently its not normal my whole adult life has been filled with stress either lots of it before looming deadlines or smaller doses of every day stress like a general sense of worry about money career social interactions time etc my partner doesnt experience this he doesnt worry about something unless its about to happen because in his opinion worrying wont help the situation hes been down to his last 200 in a foreign country before and managed to find a job before his money ran out so i guess his lack of stress was justified he tells me all the time that i shouldnt be stressed so much because theres no point in doing so on the other hand i stress about everything because i feel that if im not stressing i wont be prepared for when something unexpected happens like if i have a leaking pipe and need to spend thousands fixing the damage how do you not feel the urgent need to make sure you have enough money to prepare for something like that whats normal is it normal to be stressed every day or is it normal to not be stressed unless something big is about to occur how do i stop worrying about things that are rationally beyond my control when a part of me believes that if i can anticipate it ill be prepared for when it happens ugh now im stressing about whether im too stressed life is stressful any ideas on how to stop stressing about every little thing,1

tomorrow my depression will be one year old i dont know if i need to celebrate or to complain my self i am 18 years old i am from mexico and until a few months ago i realized that i could have something upset at the beginning of august 2019 my life took a pretty good turn everything was going to improve and it did my school demanded so much time that i didnt have time for anything i was extremely happy everything was going well grades friends i was even going to start a relationship with a very special girl my family had finally found a balance when the pandemic arrived i was not so affected but it all started when my cousin decided to commit suicide on august 31 2020 without any sign or warning it was all very sudden they asked me to give a few words at his funeral but i couldnt and all those things that i still had to say i kept to myself all this year i had good times and bad but little by little everything rotted my family separated completely my school closed and that dream of having graduated from that school disappeared after all i filled many of my afternoons smoking marijuana and tried to fill in those little holes that i was living in march it was the last time i saw my mother because of a stupid thing i did and that every day makes me feel guilty i filled my days with depressing philosophy i walked away from all my friends my life really stopped sometimes i start to think and i imagine myself with a psychologist talking about my problems and only realizing that my life is wrong but what could it be wrong i do not have any disability or something some disease that prevents me from being happy but problems overwhelm me and take my breath away i am speechless in these situations sometimes i start to think what would have happened to me if the whole pandemic hadnt happened i just wanted to share my story thanks for reading,1
does anyone habitually say things like i fucking hate myself ive developed a habit of saying depressive thoughts out loud bc im always alone always thinking them and talk to myself when no ones looking its reached the point where instead of saying fuck when something goes wrong ill say i want to kill myself its become so engrained in my mind that ive come close to accidentally saying these when other people are around anyone else do this,1
is it normal to get stressed out over such little things i work a relatively simple job where i dont really earn much but i dont really do much either but there are days where something as simple as one of the lights not switching on properly can just flip me out of focus and make it impossible to get anything done and while not being a violent person at all i feel like i just need to hit the wall to get it all out of me is it normal i feel like my problems are so small and shouldnt cause my any stress,1

suicide isnt the answer but people shouldnt call it the cowards way out i mean someone faced such an awful life filled with hardship and people are going to call them cowardly in my opinion thats seriously low they dont know what theyve been through how are you going to call someone cowardly if you dont know their story or have never felt the exact feelings they felt everyone processes pain differently even though it could be no big deal for you it could be pain and anguish for someone else there is no such thing as a coward everyone is brave in one way or another sorry for the ventrant but i seriously hate life but im too stubborn to give up and i dont want to be called a coward because of the few times ive thought about ending things because they got too hard or stressful i dont necessarily mean killing myself but ive thought about giving up getting life together getting in shape because depression is so hard to break out of but i will always keep trying,1

depression is living in a body that fights to survive with a mind that tries to die this was the caption of a photo that my classmate submitted for a photography class we have this facebook group where we submit all our photography works and it just resonated with me depression is such an ass struggling with depression has fucked with my life so bad that i ended up selfharming and nearly killing myself three times this year and i couldnt do it because im too afraid i want things to end but i couldnt at this moment im not suicidal im not even at the point that im severely depressed to the point i cant function normally it just resonates with my struggle especially with my experience for years but this year in particular the fact that my mind has been telling me to die but my body doesnt the fact that i still have it despite having great family friends and a loving girlfriend the fact that it has been affecting my life quite severely the fact that it gives me anxiety and doubt for the future and ultimately the fact that i realize that its such a miracle that im waking up each day still alive and bravely battling depression peace out and much love,1

gamers made me depressed i know thats a bold statement i made a similar post on reddit a while back but it got deleted after my google account was suspended because of that and the fact that a lot has transpired since then i figured i would repost the story here as typical of pretty much everyone born since the 80s i was into games ever since i was little got my wii when i was 6 played turok with my halfbrother on his old gaming device and poured hours into minecraft so as soon as i saw the trailer for fallout 4 back in 2015 i was almost immediately hooked ive always been a history buff along with being fascinated by dystopias and american nostalgia so fallout seemed right up my alley i was even more hyped when i saw a video from a youtuber i liked at the time that talked about the fallout universe and the lore behind it sadly i was only 11 at the time so it wasnt likely my parents would let me buy it but i was patient and by 2017 i was finally able to play let me say i absolutely loved it i thought the story was heartwrenching and i fell in love with all the characters in the game over the next year i went on to play both 3 and new vegas and loved them just as much although as time went on i started to realize people had different opinions as me which is fine i want to make it clear right now that i do not have a problem with people disliking things i like in fact there are plenty of other opinions in which i hold that are wildly unpopular online hell at first i wasnt even mad they disagreed with me i just saw us as having a differing opinion and left it at that but as i spent more time online it became more and more annoying to see some of these fans talk they seemed to act as if what they loved was objectively superior and then rub it in my face this post is a good example and this one there are a lot more i could show you but i think you get the picture moving along i was able to tune it all out even after fallout 76 came out a game that was reviewed so poorly it seemed to vindicate these fanboys i personally didnt like 76 anyway and figured that most of the hate was independent of the hate for 3 and 4 so i continued to enjoy games as much up until the summer of 2019 but there was one last thing that truly kicked off my depression theres a fallout youtuber called oxhorn he seemed like a decent youtuber and i was even comforted by the fact that he seemed to be a big name in the community and liked fallout 4 well i soon found that after fallout 76 came out people were out there trying to cancal him some of the things people were saying about him let me down but i saw it as an opportunity to see these people for who they really were people who were willing to smear someone for what they did or didnt like people also seemed to side with oxhorn when it came to his response which got a few hundred thousand views so i was at peace well as if the universe wanted to fuck me over the wellrespected youtuber the right opinion made his own video on the matter one that got over a million views and effectively ruined my life it seemed that the new vagas fanboys won in the end their ability to smear people if they liked something they didnt calling them names while jacking off for the game that was special to them without consideration for what was special to me since then things have gotten much worse everywhere i look online people praise new vegas and constantly use it to oneup 4 its even extended to real life i talked with a guy recently who claimed i had a bad taste in character and in games for expressing my opinions on new vegas someone else chimed in and said you do realize new vegas is the most critically acclaimed fallout game right a message thats been repeated to me again and again yes i get it everyone fucking loves new vegas i loved it too everyone also hates fallout 4 and apparently i have shit taste in storytelling because i loved it as well i get it maybe youre right maybe im just one big idiot whose opinions are invalid and no one agrees with them thats fine but why do you gotta rub it in my face now i cant enjoy games anymore all the fun just seemed to be sucked out of them the sad part is i only really got to play four mature games on my own the three fallout games i already mentioned and a fourth one called we happy few but after all this drama it was taken away from me the real irony is that when i finally got the chance to play a game the outer worlds that was made by the original creators of fallout which these new vegas fanboys were worshiping as a genius i was already too depressed to play it its not even just fallout i cant play a single game with the excitement and enthusiasm i once did i guess thats because of the gaming community in general the instant fanboyism and hatred for companies that i couldnt give a shit about i know youll probably argue i shouldnt let it get to me believe me for the longest time it didnt but it just became too much now ive lost an important part of my life its because of this ive been severely depressed for the past couple of years keep in mind this isnt the only reason im feeling this way i dont have many friends i feel as if i fail at everything i do and im just feeling like life has no meaning so ya know typical depression bull shit its just that gaming was a big coping mechanism for much of my life so to have it stripped away from me as this has really caused me to become apathetic about pretty much everything it makes me feel like i cant go on any longer i actually went berserk recently and made many reddit posts telling people they fucked up my life i know that was insane but i didnt know what to do i felt so alone i felt like i knew one was listening i went on to post a video onto youtube saying i was going to you know end it all my dumb ass even had the balls to email ign and demand them to spread my story i know its crazy believe me i was desperate i just wanted people to understand how i felt i know no one does thats fine all i know is im just depressed you dont have to understand if ya cant i just want people to listen i know all this sounds dumb i want to reiterate that this isnt only just because of games and even if it was they were pretty important to me a lot of you guys grew up on games you must know what its like to be my age it was something that kept me through the day and now its gone i feel like my adolescence has been robbed from me i was only 15 when i stopped enjoying games now im 17 and i dont imagine ill have time for them in the future id like to conclude on one note if any of you ever held any opinions that were different from mine thats fine ive always respected them and i will continue to respect them but if you acted cruelly or did everything you could to make me feel this way then congratulations its because of you that my life feels empty its because of you ive lost one of my favorite hobbies i hope youre happy,1
there is no space for people like me typing this out feels so painful and pointless there is no space for men like me in this society men who dont fit in this societys definition of handsome or beautiful or sexy it doesnt matter if you are a cheat or an abuser a 2530 bmi with a nice looking face is the free pass by now you have decided put in one of those boxes called incel or something similar i understand that i would also have done that too a few years back god i dont even have the energy to tell the complete story and you dont have the time either long story short my ex came in to my life 12 years ago to escape a mentally and physically abusive relationship and we found happiness proper happiness among the maddening chaos of med school and utter hopelessness of everything else we shared laughter and tears she loved me i loved her it isnt easy loving someone in a country we live in people around us used to consider us constantat least those 3 or 4 people who are my friends although she was my only best friend i say this again she was the only person in my 27 something years of my life who was kind to me we shared each others trauma she became my entire life and i was her entire life too at least for 7 years or so then she walked away one day its not you its me out of the blue we almost got married almost over the years i have always been proud of our fidelity and loyalty and considered them to be the forte of whatever we had i guess happy people look beautiful women approached me everyday mostly because of my career i never looked sideways she walked away to be with a friend from her med school in a matter of days i heard that he dropped her then girlfriend on a single day notice he had practice my entire world collapsed in a matter of moments i entered my hell i have been here for the last 45 years no sleep cycle no one to talk to no respite i have literally spent weeks or months in complete solitude not even my parents talk to me when i say talk i dont mean long conversations i havent heard a hello or a good morning or a happy birthday in these years i stayed entirely mum for weeks at a stretch i tried to kill myself 3 or 4 times all i think of is a way to die peacefully but she kept coming back quite a few times this new guy supposedly abused her verbally and physically but she went back because he was a poor thing not economically his parents are filthy rich and he doesnt feel any moral obligation not to use that money he is a poor thing because he suffers from liver disease due to excessive drinking and drugs did i mention that i am the prude who does not smoke and drinks socially literally twice a year on average oh and she accused me of emotional abuse and made up things so that she could justify going back to him i am guilty of letting her repeat this cycle quite a few times i love her i cant help it only a kind word from her mouth soothes my soul i had built my world around her bit by bit i forgot all the childhood trauma all those bullies all those unkind words i forgot i wasnt beautiful she made me feel beautiful i worshipped her i was so thankful to god for finally making me happy i thought it was our happily ever after and then i lost everything i cant face myself in the mirror people dont approach me like before because they know something is broken and the rest of them doesnt believe that we separated so here i am typing this fucking thing out the new loser creep there is no sympathy for people like me in this society i have tried to hate her with everything i have i could not i cannot i just hate myself more for not being enough now i dream about my death in vivid details i was the quite nerd in school she made me come out my cocoon and now i have nothing to survive i havent smiled or laughed in 4 years i have suffered death of loved ones and more misfortunes i have been backstabbed by people whom i considered to be close from a promising academic talent to a useless recluse i dont think i can be a good doctor anymore if you read this thanks for listening mental health care is not available where i live thank you for reading this,1
i feel like my mental health professionals dont care but i cant tell if thats the depression talking hi im sorry if this is the wrong sub for this question i dont normally like to discuss my mental health problems because i think that makes my problems feel worse but i need some outside judgement here ill keep this as quick as possible but im afraid its still going to be a little long im in a partially hospitalized mental health program which means that i go to a hospital 6 hours a day 5 days a week i see psychiatrists and therapists there but i fill my own prescriptions at my local pharmacy ive been in this program 3 weeks with 1 to go at the beginning of the program the psychiatrist wanted to adjust the dose of one of my medicines instead of just ordering a prescription for pills at the new dose she decided to order 30 pills which were each about a third of the new dose so that i could take a little more or less as she thought appropriate from the beginning she told me to take 3day i took 3day so the 30 pills only lasted 10 days i had to really bug my therapist to get a new appointment with the psychiatrist after that 10 days was up even though this medicine is one of the ones you cant just stop taking safely finally i got to see her 13 days from when she wrote the original prescription which was this last friday when i went to fill the new prescription at about 4 that afternoon the pharmacy tech told me that my insurance wouldnt cover the new pills because my psychiatrist had written one a day on the original prescription he said he could give me the pills but id have to pay the full sticker price of 780 instead of my nice co pay 0 i stayed calm because i thought this was just a stupid mistake and called my psychiatrist who nonchalantly told me that the pharmacy tech was wrong and that i should just be more assertive about filling the prescription if that didnt work she said i could try good rx i tried good rx and only got 40 off i called back this time panicking a bit at exactly 4 17 pm the secretary informed me that the psychiatrist had just walked out but offered to refer me to my therapist my therapist was kind but said something which boiled down to friday at 4 is almost friday at 5 and no one here is going to be able to help you on friday at 5 i ended up coming back the next day and with the help of good rx and the incredibly kind pharmacy tech getting the pills for 113 i just want to know is the programs response or lack thereof normal are most mental health professionals this laid back about seemingly urgent stuff or do mine really just not care i have only had 1 other psychiatrist and shes awesome i plan on returning to her after this program so i know she would never do this the depressed hopeless voice in the back of my brain is telling me that these people really dont give a fuck and that i should just give up and not return for my last week whether or not that is a reasonable conclusion how can i push myself to go back to the program despite feeling hurt and confused by this thanks in advance for your help edit i just realized while taking my abilify that she wrote 12 tablet daily on the prescription of 30 tablets i was only supposed to take 12 of a tablet for the first 6 days after that she told me to take 1 tablet a day does this mean my insurance wont cover a refill of the abilify until 60 days have passed this is more rhetorical because i think i know the answer i know im really lucky in a way because my financial position is safe enough that this isnt a huge issue but i want to scream at these people the pharmacy tech said this is basic prescriber knowledge and im pretty certain he wasnt wrong,1

do you think that your mind has a mind of its own without even realizing our mind seems to be governed by another entity which is called the subconscious mind have you ever been surprised by the power of your subconscious brain perhaps it took control of the wheel as your conscious mind was busy tackling a problem during a 30minute drive home you barely remember making your way from the office but then your car ended up safely in your driveway know that more than 95 of your mental processing occurs at the subconscious level even as you read this sentence more than 95 of the thinking and analyzing in your brain is subconscious thinking and analysis subconscious thinking occurring at speeds exceeding 15th of a second even before you become aware of a decision or thought the subconscious parts of the brain have already thought and decided for you heres a youtube video if you want to understand the language of this powerful source that is the subconscious how to recognize what people are really doingsaying on a subconscious level and how to eventually influence yours,1
this is how i tried to explain to my gamer friend how depression feels like when one of my friends asked me to explain how it feels i was at a loss for words at first but then i remembered that we both like video games and tried it like this thought id share it maybe people can relate to it edit thank you all so much it means a lot to me that it means a lot to you okay imagine youre playing an rpg and youve been going through the most hellish dungeon ever youve been unprepared underleveled and barely survived then at the end you find one of the most awesome pieces of loot ever its called the cape of depression its completely op putting it on would give you immunity to nearly everything the game can throw at you sure there are some negative stats on it too but those seem managable you put it on and its as awesome as you thought it would be nothing can harm you it doesnt deflect or defend you against attacks they simply pass through you nothing can touch you anymore swords arrows fireballs doesnt matter its all the same to you because you simply dont feel it anymore for some time you feel like a god you glide through the masses and its exhilerating nobody can touch you youre completely free but the cape has disadvantages it doesnt just let attacks pass through you but also any blessings healing spells and potions sure its a bit inconvenient at first but youll manage after all nobody can hurt you anymore so you dont need these kind of things anymore actually you dont even miss them anymore since you put on the cape everything has felt the same anyway and those signs of affection dont have any practical purpose to you anymore so why bother so you continue with your quest wrapped in the cape but somehow it doesnt feel the same anymore nobody can hurt you anymore so you walk right through your enemies not bothering to fight nobody can heal or comfort you anymore so you walk right through your allies too not bothering to talk its just you and the cape its starting to get boring so you think about trying it without the cape but as you try to take it off you look down at yourself and realize that youre still carrying the very same injuries you got in the dungeon in which you found the cape they never healed but you never got any more either then you remember how difficult and dangerous it was without the cape its easy to remember too after all you have those injuries to prove your point you need the cape so you decide to leave it on at some point things just happen around you without you taking notice anymore nothing can affect you neither good or bad so why bother youre truly like a god now but not in the grand majestic kind of way you are simply not in touch both literally and metaphorically with the normal people around you anymore maybe youre mildly confused and irritated by them why do they act like they do whats the point you dont want to feel left out like a freak so you pretend to still be in touch with them the cape helps you it grants you a 10 to acting and deceiving when talking about yourself and you need that buff because if someone would come to close to you touch you they would see that they pass right through you and realize something is very very wrong you dont want that so you stay away from others which in turn makes you even more distant by the time youve realized that the cape was cursed its already too late it has become a part of you its wrapped around you around your true self you are still somewhere inside but around your true self is that vast cloak of nothing that keeps any feeling no matter if good or bad out youve worn the cape for so long that you have forgotten how it feels to feel when you go to your allies and ask for help they dont see what the cape has done to you they only see the old wounds and think you must be in pain they cast their healing spells on you but they pass right through you however all they see is that those old wounds just wont heal so they get frustrated and give up its just you and the cape edit 2 oh and i while this was not in my original explanation i feel that this should definately be in though some of the worst days are those when the cape randomly shifts your alignment to neutral evil suddenly you can feel again but the cape allows you only one single feeling anger youre angry at the cape for having so much power over you youre angry at yourself for letting it happen and youre angry at your enemies and allies alike you start to remember every single time insult and injury from the small goblin that threw rocks at you all the way up to the lich sending wave after wave of mindless undead after you you remember every single time your tank failed to protect you every single healing spell cast just a second too late suddenly youre the fickle god again looking down on the masses with a smile of disdain on your face for a moment youre glad you feel and then the next day its over the cape has worked its curse again only to leave you ashamed and guilty for being cruel to your allies and vindictive towards your enemies but fear not the cape is still there wrapping you in nothing that protects you from nothing,1

is thinking about worse case scenarios an unhealthy way to deal with stress for example i find that thinking of people that are in worse conditions than myself reminding yourself of death and other morbid things that are going on in the world gives me perspective of life it makes me ask myself eg is this stupid job or person really worth my mind exerting effort to stress over when none of this really matters in the end,1

ive never felt so sad alone lonely and isolated before at the same time i want to stay isolated i dont want to socialize or be around people i dont quite understand whats going on with me i might be broken i know that i can talk to friends and family about my feelings but at the same time i just feel like there is no one i can talk to nor do i possess the capacity to voice my feelings aloud whenever i try talking with a friend i just clam up i dont understand myself i dont understand why i am like this why cant i just express how im feeling maybe because expressing feelings aloud makes them real or permanent a perspective voiced gives permenamce to those thoughts im still unsure of anything and everything,1

how i learned to control my migraines hey guys i thought id share my story of dealing with migraines i used to start getting them for what i thought was absolutely no reason i was always an anxious person but when i started my first job after college i started getting these stress migraines and they were debilitating i would come home from work and just lie down for hours until i fell asleep only to wake up with the pain the next day the underlying cause was stress and i would experience other bodily manifestations of my stress such as bloating excessive sweating and sleep issues as you can imagine my body was a wreck while i still experience these feelings from time to time i have them significantly more under control and rarely get these uncomfortable feelings heres how i was able to take care of them first and foremost while i did meditate and it did help i realized the underlying cause was that i wasnt focusing on the task in front of me and was instead trying to multitask when you try and multitask you cause anxiety anxiety is being here but wanting to be there this would take a toll on my mental energy once i stopped trying to multitask and focus only on the task at hand my migraines started to become less frequent meditation helps with this because you are asked to practice concentration next when i experienced these feelings i approached them with a sense of curiosity why was my body reacting this way instead of getting upset at our body like most of us do when we get these feelings i started listening to my body i realized that stress and anxiety are trying to tell me something these emotions are my ally as opposed to my enemy i came up with a great analogy as to why i was getting these migraines when you consistently put unhealthy food inside your body what happens you get a stomach ache when you consistently put unhealthy thoughts inside your mind you get a mindache or a migraine once i came up with that analogy i was more mindful of what thoughts i was letting inside of my mind youll be surprised with the kind of garbage you let inside of your mind thats what these feelings are telling you so becoming curious about them really helped by this point i was experiencing the physical manifestations of stress a lot less frequently but i was still experiencing them this brings me to my final point trust and believe in the process these wont disappear overnight however if you noticed changed up until now which i did i trusted the process and eventually i almost virtually eliminated them i hope that helps those of you who are suffering from stressrelated migraines i tried to keep this as short and digestible as possible so i left out a lot of detail but please comment or pm me if you want me to expand on anything further i know how much these suck so im happy to help out further if i can,1
my life partner got to be a host for pbs and im just so ecstatic my life partner is awesome she is a performing artist she is a disability advocate and she is honestly just the most interesting and engaging person ive ever met but i suppose im biased anyways its hard out here making a name for oneself but she wrangled an opportunity to be a host for a pbs pilot and it just came out today and it is just so wonderful to see her succeeding despite all the consternation opposition anxiety and doubt that she works through to do this kinda shit shes worked so hard and come so far but i think this is one of the first times her successes actually broke through all that and hit her in the face like this is her job to be an awesome person and theres just no better validation than that anyways peace and love to anyone who reads my rant lol,0

stress is causing pain which is making stress worse what to do hi i discovered not too long ago that when im really stressed out i get pains in my abdomen i know that its stress and not something more sinister because the first two times it happened i was extremely stressed and i went to my doctor who could find nothing wrong with me physically the pain in my abdomen while i know is not harmful still freaks me out it occurs on the right side and is often low which of course makes me jump right to appendicitis then i start hyper focusing on that and stressing myself out more which in turn makes the pain worse its a pretty vicious cycle i am currently on medication for gad but it doesnt seem to be doing much to help i have a doctors appointment in a week and a half and plan on speaking to her about maybe switching medications but is there anything that i can do to manage my stress until then while it does subside on its own its still quite miserable and kind of scary thanks,1

i will never understand how people can live and be happy life is just objectively bad everything seems to be literally designed to bring you down even our own bodies are designed to keep us from being content think about drugs that make you feel good eventually your body will reach a point where it needs more and more to reach the same effect until you overdose and die you try to set up goals you complete them and keep seeking more you get money you want more people say practice graditude for what why should i live a life where i constantly need to remind myself of trivial good things when everything is basically objectively bad your loved ones eventually die you die people kill each other on a daily basis do horrible things to each other you work until you die when you are young you have energy and time but no money when you are an adult you have money and energy but no time when you are old if you are lucky you have money and time but no energy and most likely riddled with sickness and lost most of your loved ones life is always out of balance to kick you down the only way you can possibly live a nice life is if you are so rich you can just do whatever you want without working and help the ones you love to do the same what are the odds of that almost zero im just tired of it all i wish i never existed because life is simply not worth living and i dont think anyone will ever change my mind no one has been able to help me no meds psychiatrist psychologist life habit nothing,1

could my husband be depressed how could i help long story short we have been together for 15 years his family is pure academics both parents and siblings are phds and postdocs from prestigious schools i later learned that his mom had been suffering from depression very early on and had been taking medication for a long time his sister is also depressed to a point that she could not go to class and do home work his mom had to fly to her school to watch her she is still taking medication my husband on the other hand is also a little crazy he always have very unrealistic ideas and it was all talks no action of any sorts i am really tired of just being the listener and know its pure talk i am a little angry right now because we just had an argument i am pregnant in my third trimester and he was keep saying the house we live in is shit the weather is too hot the whole place is shit he had no friends and no jobs the world is collapsing and he wanted to abandon me to live in a mountain by the lake in chattanooga he just stopped taking coffee and it could be just his withdrawal symptoms that is another thing his mom his sister and himself were all extremely addicted to alcohol and caffeine they all tried other drugs in schools but i dont think they are taking them anymore we always have arguments whenever he is drinking too much or having withdrawals i wish i could just deal with it once and not all the time this emotion ups and downs i wish he could go to a therapist and get tested but he is too proud to do it he says i am the one that has mental problems i do not drink alcohol or caffeine or smoke or have done any drugs in my life and i do not have any family history mental illness,1

so i have this virus depressionexe on my computer about a year ago i realized my computer was running slower than usualof course this took me a few weeks to realize since the decrease in performance was gradual once i realized i opened the process tab and find this program depressionexe running hogging a lot of my cpu im fairly sure its a virus but the weirdest thing is that i havent been downloading anything that would contain a virus and as far as i can tell it doesnt even have a function its only purpose is to hog cpu and make it more difficult to perform basic functions so anyway i try closing it but nothing happens i try again until windows gives me the typical depressionexe is not responding obviously i click close now and wait a bit but still nothing happens i keep clicking everywhere and mashing buttons to end the program psa this is an awful idea trying to do too much will only overload your computer but my desktop only freezes oh well i say ill just restart the computer and hope that tomorrow ill have more success in getting rid of the virus the next week or so i keep mashing buttons and hitting end now but again this only overloads my computer and forces me to shut down for the day meanwhile the virus has been getting greedier and is taking up more and more of my cpu programs run slower and i experience more stutters and lags in processing eventually i gave up trying to end depressionexe by conventional means and sought antivirus software the software was a bit of a pain to install at first and costed a chunk of change and unfortunately did no good sure it was able to detect the virus it turns out that its not so uncommon but was useless in actually removing it i had the same experiences with other antivirus software not powerful enough didnt detect the problem misidentified the virus the list goes on i still try to run antivirus software once a week just in case but most of the time it just uses up even more cpu some other users try to help but its obvious they never had this malware have you tried turning it on and off again sometimes when my computer is overloaded i just need to delete a lot of processes for a bit or itll run quickly again youll see they dont understand just how terrible depressionexe is its difficult because i rely on this computer for school work you name it when i first had the virus it wasnt too difficult to still carry out my responsibilities but since the virus has grown its become much more difficult some days the computer wont even boot up i miss assignments and fall behind all because of this awful virus i see others whose computers run just fine and wonder what i did to get this virus and how my computer is just so different compared to theirs when we have the same model some days i just want to scrap my computer even though i cant afford a new one edit thanks so much for the positive response guys ive enjoyed reading all your responses and hope you get a hug for every bad day youve had,1
unsure how to help more i personally have been dealing with depression and a few other things for quite a few years however im still at a loss on how to help my suicidal sister and im looking for advice my depression has never got to the point of suicidal thoughts so im unsure how to really help my sister is older than me and has ocd depression aspergers and ptsd my sister has been onoff suicidal for more than four years now and she is very vocal to me about it i am the only family member she will tell also almost every time i see her when im back home she tells me that she wants to kill herself and it used to be even more often to the point where i couldnt focus on school anymore she also asks me for suicide methods and basically asks me for advice on how to kill herself i usually try to sit down and listen to her vent about why shes feeling that way but i feel like it never helps i have also recommended the suicide hotline as another form of help bc i didnt know what to do me and my other sister have had to get her checked into a psych ward a few times when she started making a suicide plan last time it happened was last week she lives with a really toxic mother not my mom and also has a lot of trauma from our dad i have tried to help her make a plan to get out of that living situation but she doesnt try to she also barely tells her therapist whats going on and wants to quit i am unsure what else i can do and to be honest i am getting very drained having to be told that she is going to kill herself every time she leaves my house i also have things im dealing with this has been going on for years to the point where i avoid talking to her because im afraid she will tell me shes going to kill herself again tldr sister suicidal for years and only tells me refuses help idk what to do anymore and im very drained,1

stress is starting to overcome my life help i have always been stressed when i was in my teenage years i had migraines everyday medically unexplained for years turns out it was just my bodys way of coping with stress i have been better at handling said stress with the years i am now doing pretty good at handling myself with a normal level of stress however i am still handling stress badly when it is a new amount of stress for example here new job bought an apartment w my boyfriend but things are not so good between us having to move to a new place a friend living on my couch for some time it is tiring for me to be under stress like that it makes me cry randomly have bad headaches and lash out a lot i dont want to but it seems like my stress needs to escape my body in any possible way i am comfortable around my boyfriend so it happens a lot that i am losing it around him because it feels like a safe environment it is however making my relationship more difficult than it should be to the point where he says he is really considering ending it any idea how i could help coping with my stress in a bit of an healthier way,1

have you ever felt anxiety taking over your stomach i did untill i sat down and put all my attention on that area affected by my anxiety and started to slowly consciously guide my breath there what happened next was so unreal to me at that time i felt that area which was hot from anxiety become cold and colder as the stuck energy was being dispelled and after a while it felt as if i swallowed an ice cube which reached the depth of my stomach to that location to me this says a lot about how important it is to consciously breathe at specific times for example did you know that certain diseases thrive in an oxygen less body the most interesting thing about breathing i learned is that it is one of the many expressions from what many would call prana chi lifeforce prana qi ki pit rapture chills spiritual chillls goosebumps ecstasy euphoria aura mana ruah nephesch and many more i made this youtube video for you if you are interested in these concepts,1
no genuine interest in anything everything i do that i seem to enjoy is just so i dont become more depressed i lift weights and exercise i play pc games watch some netflix movies and youtube videosmusic if i could i would end my life this instant id also want to end all life in the universe but thats another story im pretty dead inside and just living to die ive been depressed on and off for the past 10 years mostly because life is pointless and i think its better to be dead then alive so even if i was happy id prefer to end my life philosophically speaking again as i think its better to be dead then alive i was thinking the other day that if i was told to go to work tomorrow i dont current work that i would be given 400k i really could be bothered going and probably wouldnt i mean i dont care about money and actually fantasize about being homeless basically i cant overcome my depression due to the fact that life is pointless,1
after three months of almost crippling depression i finally had the courage to call and make an appointment with a therapist and im very proud of myself ive been struggling with depression for about three months now ive had severe depression social anxiety and panic attacks in the past from 2016 to beginning of 2018 harmed myself and tried suicide a few times but i started a treatment took medications and got cured i guess depression never leaves right we just learn how to deal with it and control it but its probably never truly gone that makes me terrified but i might me wrong but now all of this feelings are coming back and im panicking i have no motivation whatsoever to go to work im arriving at least one hour late every single day i cry every morning and every night im becoming paranoid with my boyfriend and relationships in general thinking no one would want to be with me cause im a failure i get too anxious to reply to anyone im feeling alone abandoned ugly insecure unworthy stupid weak i tried to create a to do list to get me occupied stop using the uber app to go to work when i can perfectly walk its just 27 kms or about 16 miles cook my own meals and stop ordering from an app or eating junk food start exercising my apartment building has a gym where i can use wherever i want go to bed early wake up in time have breakfast before leaving the house reply to all the messages ive been avoiding for months start to be productive at work and stop scrolling through reddit get out of my art block and start drawing again post more things on my artistic social media so i can be more active start applying for jobs i dont get paid enough and hate my current job finding a new apartment to stay my roommate is my exes cousin so its a bit weird just simple things i thought i could handle and that would make me feel way better with myself but i cant i literally cant every time i try to get out of bed in the morning i cry cause i simply cant i walk in front of the gym and just want to cry cant even step on it sometimes i can even put on my gym clothes i turn on my computer i just want to die my energy starts to drop drastically and its an exhausting task to read my emails and start working im always procrastinating and pushing people away i think the thing thats bothering me the most is that i cant achieve the simplest goals and im failing even on the silliest things in day life i dont have suicidal thoughts anymore neither the urge to hurt myself so sometimes i just feel like this might not be depression its just perhaps me not trying hard enough but either way i cant live like this anymore ive been deeper before but that doesnt mean my life is wonderful it took me a few weeks to finally defeat my social anxiety and finally called the therapist my appointment will be next friday im very nervous but relieved i really hope things get better from now on so i can have a normal life again,1

i learned of a kitchen life hack tried it and it really seems to be working so usually after a week of buying potatoes they start to sprout even though i have them in what is a dark cool place and i would remove the sprouts only for the sprouts to come back again two days later i looked online and apparently if you put apples in the same place as potatoes it helps keep them from sprouting onions actually have the opposite effect and makes potatoes sprout faster i tried it i had two fuji apples that i put in with a dozen potatoes and i havent seen a single sprout so far,0
some people are just never depressed i remember months ago when my boyfriend told me he doesnt think hes ever really been depressed before hearing him say that completely blew my mind because my life has been the exact opposite for as long as i can remember and if i had the same kind of experience as him id be in such a better place right now i used to think people like that would crumble the moment something really bad happens to them but in all honesty it seems to be a strength rather than a weakness his dog who he really loved recently died and he was sad for maybe a week or two but then just bounced right back from it like nothing even happened cant imagine what that must be like im happy for him since id hate to see him have to suffer through that but also admittedly envious guess some people are just lucky enough to never have to experience this kind of daily hell that never really goes away,0

i feel lost anybody ever feel anxious or depressed at times but not really sure what the main reason is there are so many times in my life where i suddenly start to feel this sinking feeling and i start thinking and processing so many things in my mind and start to really feel like shit but i cant seem to figure out the main cause i took a break from college because of how it was wearing me down mentally but just thinking about going back or never going back just makes me spiral down this path of self loathing and i feel like im failing myself and the people around me every time i start to feel like im happy these thoughts and feelings come back and i just feel awful i genuinely feel like im one small incident away from a breakdown,1
i dont have and never have had a friend group and it hurts i try to talk to people given i am pretty introverted i dont think theres anything inherently wrong with me and im not hideous i feel like even introverted people tend to have some sort of friend group in college im in my last year of uni and i havent had one friend group ive made a few friends here and there but we never get too close i tend to spend a lot of my time alone i have never ever had a friend group in my life and i forget that it isnt normal i want to be able to go to fun places with a friend group i want to do things in a group and feel completely included and not like the third wheel the friend group could just be 3 people total even or if i could even just have a best friend who would do stuff with me i hope i can find it one day it also hurts cause i know its partly my fault i need to try harder to ask people to hang out and do things but all i want to do every day is lay in my bed the effort of putting myself out there when i feel like it never works out seems futile will things ever get better,1
i dont know what to do so my bf and i went long distance a couple days ago we have done it before and were fine but we lived 10 minutes away for 6 months and now he is in college and has a whole world of his own i talked to him on the phone for the first time today and just completely shut down i didnt know what to do and i genuinely feel like im just making his life harder even though he claims i am not i am majorly depressed and only partially medicated i feel like such a burden to him and tell him that he should leave me he tells me he doesnt want that unless that is what is better for me and he is sorry for me feeling this way i dont know how to get through this because i love him so much but i cant even talk to him on the phone rn because of the overwhelming pain it brings me meanwhile he is having a fun time in college which i am glad about but our moods are just so opposite at the moment hes super happy and glad to talk to me and i just feel like sobbing i dont know what to do he says take it day by day but how are we supposed to do that if i cant handle talking to him over the phone i feel like i am causing a rift between us bc i am not able to stop saying harmful things but it is what is all going on in my head i also feel like i caused this long distance relationship because my grades werent good enough this year to go back in person i know he cares about me so much but when do i become someone he hates because of the way my brain acts i am so lonely side note i am also in college but not in person,1

do you stay in bed for the whole day because you have no motivation or energy to do anything productive and then you start feeling guilty because youre not doing anything productive and then you try to get up to do something for once but as soon as you sit up on the bed you feel no energy whatsoever so you just lie back down and quietly wish for death lol,1
i hate it so much when you try and express your feelings to your parents but they turn it around and compare your suffering with theirs ive been feeling really depressed and lonely lately from my job im a full time late night janitor for a courthouse just 10 miles away from my hometown working there has been pretty easy but i wound up feeling super lonely a lot considering i dont really get to talk to my friends or hang out with them much so just today i came home late as usual and i have a little interaction with my mom after she made a joke to me that i took pretty personal and felts like was more of an insult rather than a sense of humor i told her that i didnt really want to joke around like that but she refused to listen and told me to just go away then despite attempting to change the topic and explain why i havent been feeling so high all she kept doing was telling what a great mom she is for raising me and my brother while struggling to make ends meet and keep the house what an ungrateful little bastard i am for not appreciating her hard work and sacrifices at that moment i was legitimately about to begin to cry but rather instead of pausing and trying to reverse the damages all my mom did was host a little parental style of the oppression olympics and proclaim her amount of tears and cries over the course of three weeks i got out just before my first tear would legitimately run down my cheek and even before i went to bed she goes on about how her life is more worse than ours then escalates into a more this is why youd make a terrible mistake getting behind the wheel considering i had practice driving this morning unaware that she had just lite the fuse to trigger the firework but she didnt seem to care thanks for reading i hope you feel better soon and find the key to unlocking your next set of happiness along with having a parent who doesnt make your suffering all about them and why you shouldnt be depressed,1
depression makes me so boring honestly i am so damn boring like its a main reason why i dont date anyone and never will its a reason why i have no friends and never will nothing really interests me so i dont have much to talk about i suck at all conversations and once again im so boring when i was a kid i had a personality i was funny and goofy and happy now im just a dead zombie that will laugh at things in public to not seem depressed but my brain is so dead from depression i cant come up with any jokes or shit the only thing i can do is listen and barely speak which i actually hate i wanna be funny and have a personality and be desirable but im not that i know its depression that causes it,1
right now in my life i am so frustrated right now in my life i am so frustrated with everything around me that it has left me tired everyday i search for a moment of happiness to feel good about myself but there is nothing that makes me feel good i keep myself busy in my studiesstarted my masters this august to take my mind off negative things but everything around me hits my mind so badly that i cannot control the impact of anything i no more have control on anything that happens to me everything just happens and i just respond as i am supposed to people around me are always demanding they want something from me every now and then and its not friendship that they want but just some favors i know they will never return and right now i dont even have any friends to talk to to deal with everything with me or even to keep me sane everyday has become exhausting and i just feel like to leave everything do nothing no studies no job no people leave everything and live somewhere in peace but i know i cannot just cut off from everything i have to have masters degree get a job but this journey is so stressful i wish i could have someone just to listen what i have to say about everything going on with me and i wish i could just get a moment to breathe,1

feeling ugly basically its exactly what it says i feel ugly when i put on my make up and i get dressed and i go out in the world i feel like i can do anything i feel like i can have anyone i want but when im in my room in pajamas my hair is not done my face has scars you can see all my flaws when i havent eaten all day and then i finally eat something and i get bloated and i feel fat and gross just tears me open inside i feel like a lot of my selfworth is based on the way that i look and how im seen to the outside world because the last person i was with kind of taught me that if i didnt look a certain way then my worth to him went down the drain and society where looks do matter no matter how you try and put it ive always grown up as a ugly girl ive always had people tell me that i was unattractive that no one could ever want me that i was fat i went through eating disorder after eating disorder i had extremely bad acne growing up and im finally at an ok weight and finally have my face cleared at least but i always feel like no one could ever love me for the way that i look people tell me im pretty i get complimented constantly but then i just think if they only knew what i look like with this off and i look at other girls who are with other guys and i just think to myself wow you really are unlovable wow theres something wrong with you you just push everybody away that even manage to get to talk to you and i know that my self talk is probably terrible but its hard sometimes its really hard to feel good about myself i feel like i have to hide from the world because nobody would really like me without all of this make up on without me constantly trying to regulate my weight and without me waking up every day and fixing myself i dont post after a certain time and its weird because i think im pretty most of the time especially without make up i dont have that selfesteem towards my own self but the way im perceived by other people is one of my biggest insecurities,1

how i overcame my pornography addiction why i started to change my life for the better this is tough for me to talk about but i thought this story will help inspire men growing up as a teenager i had a really bad pornography addiction i used to watch it 7 days a week and it really took an impact on my social life and it really made me lose my confidence it made my dating life and sex life horrible i knew i was better than that i could not believe this was taking over my life and how could i let it get this far so one day i was like fuck this i need to get my life together i started to set goals and strategies by locking all porn websites and started bettering my life by going to the gym and finding new hobbies i tried playing basketball and started doing cycling classes it was amazing i met some great friends i started eating healthier i did everything i could to take my mind off it i started to find passions and hobbies and became a personal trainer i even started dating again due to all the sex dysfunctions from watching all the pornography it was a very tough process but i was able to power through this shit and get my life somewhat together after 6 12 months so the moral of the story is do not let these addictions control you what controls your mind controls your life mental toughness,0

the worst thing about my stress is that no one sees the worst stressors hello i hope i follow the rules as this is my first post here i just need to let out how worried i am rn ill put a tldr at the end because this will be a doosie the following paragraph is just backstorywho i am im 23 straight male just finished college bachelors in general studies also im a talented musician and have had somewhat of a small business going for a couple years now utilizing a variety of instrumental and technical audio engineering skills i live on my own single in a nice little apartment and drive a 2010 malibu music is a legit income and i also drive as a doordash driver im fresh out of school and applying for entry jobs in finance and social work in the meantime i got an easy job part time at a restaurant my best friend works at my circle of friends is typical and i have an amazing immediate family 2 bros 1 sis all same parents my credit score is considered good on the scale thingy seems like im doing not too shabby right hahahahahah no let me get into my stressors now lets start with ones that folks know of i have ptsd that tends to sideline me out of nowhere it sucks but ive been pushing thru since the event happened at 17 everyone who loves me knows the details and supports me well they also understand that the entrepreneurial lifestyle i have chosen puts a lot of stress on me they know how hard i work and the sacrifice it takes im the black sheep brotherfriend who is always too busy along with every human the coco sniffles have also been a dark cloud over my life the past year or so so i have mental illness and a busy schedule weighing on me join the club right life is hard and id say the things above add up to pretty normal stress factors as a human but these are the tip of the ice burg lets break down the real demons below trigger warning for addicts lets start with the college thing since ptsd had me bedridden right after high school graduation my mom pretty much held my hand and pushed me into an easy college program im not bitter with her but that in itself could be a whole post i just question the decision these days because my love for music is pretty much all my existance contains most people assume i had a full ride to the degree since both of my older siblings have grad degrees and are doctors everyone supported my college journey like a plan b as i kept hustlin music on the side well that degree put me 20k in debt and idk if ill even use it time will tell but its just eating me alive realizing that for the next two decades i may literally spend 5 microphone booths worth of cash on a degree that just sits there so yea big debt lingering from school and lots of people dont know the details next up cars it looks like i own it but im making monthly payments on my current car those payments are set to go to my sister who owned it before me for 9 months hopefully i pay off early that one is nothin compared to the first car i ever bought which i kinda regret buying i owe 9k on a 2016 ford focus that is now on a lot because i totaled it in december remember december key detail i had full coverage but the deductable was huge like 2k i literally dont know how tf im ever going to pay back the lender if it amounts to thousands and they wont take payments being selfemployed all of 2020 has me up a creek regarding acquiring loans ive been denied so many times im on hold with it knowing too many inquiries can ding credit score the worst thing is that its march its march and im still waiting on a financial result from a car accident that happened in december speaking of credit ive been excellent at keeping balances low on the 2 small credit cards i have until about a week ago this will make sense shortly now for the real grit ive been battling porn addiction since around 14 so pretty much 10 years of just trying to get through each day without jerking it to fake people pretending to have sex i wont go into detail with the porn thing just know that its pretty much my darkest vice and with every fleeting moment i ask myself will i ever break the habbit i mean im not a 3 hours every night addict but i cant stop i cant stop fleeing to it on occasion i feel like a monster and an outofcontrol sex addict you may wonder at this point and to answer your question no i was never sexually abused ptsd is from something way different and ive had a pretty normal sex lifedating history but man i cant say no to the porn screen sometimes at my lowest point which was last week or so i paid a bunch of money trying to buy sex from snapchat hookers they all either fell through or scammed me probably a blessing if this vice keeps winning will it get worse where is this drug taking me i dont like thinking about those questions because this unseen drug is one of the most lifethreatening ones see rnofap its my secret vice no one sees it but its a constant war the hookers are where those credit cards went by the way lastly substance abuse im pretty moderate with drinking alcohol and smoking weed but recently ive found myself wanting to drink and smoke as selfmedication until recently it was just a drink here or there with friends for the first time in my life i am seeing these activities creep in as an escape from reality this is a new realization and i havent spoken to anyone i could be overthinking this one but man ive seen too many victims go off the deep end before even realizing what the heck was going on to my friends i know i probably seem perfectly normal but they havent seen the couple of times i completely blacked out all alone while theyre at work and assume im drivingin studio thats not always the case every once in a while i just mope around smoking loads of weed and watching youknowwhat in conclusion i feel like on the surface i look like a confident young man with a lot going for him and not a lot of red flags but in my soul i can feel these lethal vices coming to get me i havent been this stressed since my ptsd incident at 17 i know this has been a long post so if youre still here i genuinely appreciate you any comments are appreciated as well bless stay safe everyone tldr im a pretty normal guy i think but finance porn and alcohol and weed are starting to stress me out and im afraid im spiraling into a notgood place,1

idk what to do ive been depressed for about 8 years now its just been gradually getting worse ever since ive tried numerous times to get help i went to the mental health hospital for a week 2 months ago im currently on lithium it helped for the first few weeks but now i just feel the same i dont like to tell anybody about it because i always feel like im repeating myself my family gets frustrated friends barely listen i try to keep myself busy do things i enjoy but i always end up feeling the same ive never been this low in my life nor have i ever disliked it this much i just want to feel okay feel like im not wasting away anymore i feel like ive tried everything i just need to hang up the towel finally off myself like ive wanted to for these past 8 years but i just can never bring myself to do so because of my family if it wasnt for them id be long gone,1
after struggling for 30 years i think im finally able to explain what my depression feels like like a tree in a hurricane and my roots dont grow deep i grab hold to anything i can find but im tired of searching for things to hold on to the hurricane is forever stalled overhead some days its stronger than others but i realize theres nothing that can be done about that and my roots never grow why wont these stupid roots just fucking grow edit didnt expect this to strike a chord with so many of you i love all my crooked neighbors with my all my crooked heart,1
does anyone else feel like they either cant or are afraid to speak up about their feelings because there are many people that have it worse and you feel like you shouldnt complain i often tell myself this and it really keeps me from opening up to others about how i feel when im upset,1
what are my best options out of this burnout hi guys pretty sure ive got burnout and id live to know your thoughts on whats some options to get out of this hole i cant even think straight so planning an exit route from this mess its proving hard ill do a very brief overview of the situation male 39 3 months ago i was training for a ultra run ive been very active all my life energy has never been an issue during the training i started a new job after losing my previous job due to the pandemic its been a massive step outside my comfort zone and ive been stressed almost daily for a few month now the problem started after i did the ultra run the week after i was tired as i expected but then it just kept getting worse and worse to the point i couldnt even walk up stairs fast forward 3 months ive not been able to do any exercise my sleep is a mess i have dry mouth all the time and ive got super bad brain fog i dont want to lose this job its a serious career opportunity and could set me up for life and i dont think it would be that hard if my brain was working properly i should mention that ive had my blood tested by the doctor and there was nothing wrong i feel like im stuck in a cycle where i need to relax but my work is keeping me in a stressed state so i cant relax and that means that my burnout is never going to go away i do have holidays coming up im just praying that my brain is going to reset itself but the same time im seriously worried that if im still knackered by the end of holiday which i think could be very possible then im going to go back into a busy year of work and i am never going to break out of this cycle ive been living at home with my parents for the last year because i lost my previous job and i need to move out im ready to buy house but im really struggling with the extra pressure of even looking for a house with the way my brain is at the moment i know no job is worth giving yourself bad health but i dont actually think its the job i think that something has gone wrong with my body and the job is not helping but i dont think necessarily that the job itself is whats caused this its a combination of maybe overtraining for running combined with the stress of the lockdown and not seeing anyone for yearmy parents are isolating ending of a big relationship i had previous and the work pressure everything mixed into one somehow has just caused my body to to shut down the question how do i get out of this without losing my job ive been thinking maybe i need to go on medication to break the cycle of the stress so i can sleep better not be stressed every day at work and then my body will relax and reset i know antidepressants might be an option but i feel like theyre just a double edge swordpatch and ill just have a bunch of problems later on down the line to deal with coming off them would love to know your thoughts on this situation maybe youve been there and found a way back to full energy thanks for your time,1
depression is the hot funny meme until youre not sleeping not eating and hoping youll die in a car accident i never understood why so many people see depression as something we can all joke about so fucking carelessly and casually like its funny and relatable to see tweets and memes about how much depression sucks but it really does so much harm than good doesnt it i cant understand how this is just so commonplace i laugh at them theyre funny i see myself in them and then for hours and days upon days i lock myself in my car with a vague numbness ditching class or calling off work to just what stare off into a void and roll around uncomfortably in my drivers seat in a shitty parking lot chew through a pack of cigarettes and just try to settle down suicidal compulsions i stare in the rearview mirror and gastation bathrooms for forty minutes trying to make sense of whos looking back and why the sight of that person makes my stomach churn i dont sleep for days on end until i collapse i lose weight in 7 pound intervals the thoughts of being a fuckup and how bad i would beat the shit out of myself if i met myself on the street just stew any time im beside myself its so funny so quirky and relatable if this is relatable thats fucking tragic being a ball of despondency and wanting to break my bones with a baseball bat is something i want everyone to laugh at with me its three am here and im just having a cigarette in an empty bathroom tub because i dont wanna think about anything i wish there was a way to turn brains off medications havent worked and i dont like being medicated at all anyway it feels like hitting a plaster wall anytime i try to feel anything sure is loads of fun,1
im stressed about my upcoming birthday i am a soon to be 14m who was born on the 25 of march a few months back y parents began asking what i want for my birthday they offered hoodies even 100 bucks i declined because i felt like if i responded they would think i am some ahole child who expects something for his birthday hence i declined but the sooner my birthday is approaching the more stressed i get because a few days ago i finally realized what i wanted this thing costs 36 bucks but i need 50 bucks to purchase something thatll help me gain this thing thing is ive already asked my mother if i could use my own money for this thing and she said something like no its best to keep the cash for bad times etc referring to the recent pandemic another thing is that she has already lost one job due to the virus and my dad isnt gaining much either we are stabl3 we have good amounts of resources and really everything is going just as it always has but the problem is i feel selfish i feel like they had already gotten something for me and if i ask for money they would have just already wasted it on something else they planned to give me i feel like i shouldve came up with what i wanted earlier before the pandemic and everything i feel anxious whenever i ask for something even though they want to give me something overall i feel like an idiot and a selfish person i cant even tell whether or not i should tell them what i want or not im just worried over this thing that i reckon im overthinking if you could give me advise on what to do that would be appreciated thank you for reading,1

does hearing college is the best time of your life or enjoy being young while it lasts freak anyone else out because for me probably like for so many of us here it forces me to view my entire life as a waste of time i wouldnt even say im looking for help or reassurance with this post more just curious if this fomo is widespread ive devoted so much energy towards living the life found in college brochures tons of socialhobby clubs going out to bars and trying to dance with people attending lectures and keeping an eye out for local events whether because im interested in the event itself or because i feel like going would make me seem more interesting and i hate all of it i havent met a single person i enjoy spending time with even my academics make me miserable to top it all off when someone detects im pretending to have fun and calls me fake or disrespects me it stings for months afterwards because we know thats what life mostly is for us a choice between faking happinessconfidence or revealing just how negativepained we are and repelling all these people who want to have a good time,1

i hate how fast i go from being okay to empty and depressed i was doing fine this past month ive been getting up early and being productive and just being okay for once i started talking to this girl and things were perfect we have lots in common and we seem to be on the same boat on things i havent been in a relationship in a while but she made it clear she wants to be with me in time yesterday i invited her to hang out with my friends and i and she was just so different than she is when were alone when i tried to hold her hand she didnt let me afterwards she texted me and said shes not ready after all and realized it when i tried to show affection in front of my friends weve only been talking for about 2 weeks so it didnt completely destroy me but i just always get attached quick so im still upset about it it seems like every person i see myself with always tends to end things for one reason or another and im over it being a front line worker is exhausting as it is but having a failed almost relationship again is messing with my head and im starting to feel the darkness overwhelm my thoughts when ive spent the majority of the last few years working on fixing that its hard when i put all my effort into people that dont do the same back you know when you stare into nothing and start overthinking everything about your life im starting to think im the problem behind all these failed relationships i know shes not worth it i dont think its her specifically making me feel this way as much as the patterns that keep occurring in my love life i dont know what to do anymore tdlr things were fine until they werent and i just dont know what to do anymore,1
why i hate watching scary movies i watched the movie midsomer and i have not been able to get it out of my head i hate watching scary movies but in the past i would get over them in about a day or so because the things in them were fake things like ware wolves ghosts vampires immortal men running around killing people and other things that dont exist but midsomer its a story thats plausible if you dont know what it is its about a cult and its fucked up that movie i have not been able to get over and its been 4 days its giving me anxiety i keep thinking morbid things will happen to me or the people around me i havnt been able to sleep with my door open or the lights off my boyfriend has had to stay the night every night because otherwise i cant sleep im 23 years old and i work in an er where i see actual injuries and people actually die and that doesnt keep me up at night but that movie has screwed with my head i hate watching scary movies and i only watch them with my family once a year which is around halloween my family states that my immunity does not exist in the month of october i know this is page is about stress but that movie has given me so much anxiety that i feel stressed i havnt drank soda in four days because my heart feels like its racing all the time and i know caffeine and sugar will only make it worse not sure what to do to get over this ive never been affected by a movie this way before,1
not wanting to live and wanting to die are two very different things imo many people dont seem to understand that when i say things like i dont want to exist or i wish i could disappear i dont mean i want to kll myself i dont want to take physical actions to end my life i dont want death i just want a break from all the exhaustion press a standby button and come back when existence feels worth experiencing again,1

pfmlfmla for this nightmare edit i spoke with my hr as well as my psychiatrist it looks like i do qualify and im currently working it out with them now im going to try making this short but i dont think i can been dealing with clinical depression and anxiety since i was 8 i made a career move into it back in 2015 after i got married basically we both agreed i was miserable where i was and that i needed to quit and finish school okay done got an as in it sec got an entry level job at a financial institution worked there for a year busted my ass got a promotion and a pretty decent raise already put me financially ahead of where i had been at my previous job was doing really well i was homelabbing at least a few times a week going to the gym lost a shitton of weight finally got my adhd treated then here comes a toxic coworker that did almost nothing and complained about literally everything at this point i was the middleguy sysadmin there taking care of the servernetwork environment guy suffered pretty terribly from depression but his mode of coping was to just trash everyone and bring everyone else down having dealt with depression for essentially my entire life i felt bad for the guy and helped him when i could but him being there planted a seed that would slowly grow into the darkest place ive ever been he was there for a year and a half before my manager finally got his head out of his ass and replaced him it was already too late for me every time a user would talk to me id immediately be frustrated i stopped doing things that i thought were stupid and all around my work ethic basically disappeared made a terrible decision to jump to an msp basically like outsourced it for those uninitiated seemed like a great happy group of people and i needed that in my life fast forward to just over 2 years i dont even know who i am anymore i never ever wanted children but mistakes happen and now i have one i love him dearly but i cant stop thinking about how ive forced him into this shitty world i cant remember the last time ive slept more than a couple hours at a time im fat again and this job does nothing but pile on work despite literally nobody having time to do any of it i cant shut off from this place i would like to make it work but unless i can get my depression in check it will cost me my job soon i know because i was recently spoken to about it i guess in summation is depression something that can qualify for pfml hell even regular fmla though now that i have a child to support i dont think i can float the bills for too long so any amount of pay will help i cant do this anymore and certainly not alone i dont know how much longer i can keep doing this sorry for the wall of text for something that should have been very short but now that ive made myself cry ill stop,1
feeling low and dumb im feeling pretty low at the moment online classes leave me feeling drained and the work just keeps piling up and my parents are on my case for doing well in my future college entrance tests for design because they think im being lazy i feel no inspiration for drawing which is my go to method for destressing i probably sound pretty whiny but i dont know i just feel so tired mentally and physically which is dumb because i legit sit at home all day,1
im the biggest disappointment in the world i hate myself for the following reasons im lazy i dont have a passion in life my biggest fear in life is my parents hating me not in the sense that they kick me out and leave me homeless etc that wont happen in the sense that they hate me as a person im not like them they do everything fast and quick and do it well my dad started from nothing and managed to give me a wonderful life me on the other hand i had everything handed to me and i couldnt do anything with it im 20 and i hate myself i wish i wanted to go to college and if not i wish i had some kind of talent so i could build my life around it sadly i dont theres gonna be a day in my near future where my parents begin to look at me as the worlds biggest failure and that they regret having me or wish they had a kid who wasnt useless the bar was never set high for me but i couldnt even do the bare minimum all i do is cry all day in my room but my parents havent noticed because i lock myself and i cry silently i just need this feeling to go away its so scary to think that life is just one big disappointment maybe i was wired this way or maybe i fucked it up its been weeks and my heart is heavy all the time in fear and panic,1
gaming wont distract me forever lately im gaming 610 hours out of the day just to distract myself from feeling empty i guess its better than wallowing in my depression but the minute i stop im back to suicide ideation i get it cant fix my problems but the anxiety of stopping and letting myself feel is too much its getting bad again really bad and i cant really talk to anybody in my life about it im not eating im not sleeping im just exisiting at this point and not really living i just think if i pull myself away from the screen ill give into the temptations that keep haunting me edit wow i honestly didnt expect this to blow up thank you everyone for your kindness i appreciate it so much the amount of support through your comments and messages is incredible thank you so much i shouldve mentioned i do have a job its a casual job but it pays the bills and i also do have a therapist who is also great but i at times feel like i shelter him from a lot of whats been going on i have friends and family i could talk to but with my history of mental health it would just burden them more than it already has i will try reply to everyones comments and messages,1

how do people just accept working 40 hours a week for the rest of their lives i know this is just how society workswe have to work in order to benefit from the work of othersthe exchange of labor it seems like most people have just accepted this as reality they get their work done and then enjoy the rest of their time and the things they get to do with the money theyve earned working but i cant seem to do that the idea of spending more than half my waking hours 5 days a week doing something i dont want to do and find stressful for someone else makes me feel so incredibly hopeless its only saturday and im already dreading entering a whole new workweek this feeling gets much worse on sundays and then during the week i come home from work and know i have to go back in a matter of hours and the thought makes me miserable and basically ruins the time i dont have to be working i feel like i spend 5 of my 7 days a week just wishing they were over thats depressing to me anyone else feel this way,1

i cant stand it anymore im committing suicide this is my story being good and positive wont help u stop suffering why does this happen to me honest to god i hate my life so much im a 16 year boyi try to make every negative thing positive but it doesnt works so much has happen to me in the last year my parents and sister passed away in an accident last year i dont if i should feel bad since theyve tortured me mentally and physically my whole life i never though much of it but once my uncle raped me at 6 and told me to shut up or hell kill me when i came of age i found out the truth i revealed it to my parents who tried to get me arrested for being mentally ill just because they wanted to save face but what has happened happened i escaped the morning after they found out and tortured me to shut upsame night they tried to get me arrested i escaped and entered foster care when i was 1314 im in my last year in high school i have my gcse and i cant study with due to the time limit my carer has given me and it just doesnt work because the house is far from my school so it takes long to travel i travel for 4 hoursmostly walkingits 74 miles however i take multiple bus routes and walk for an hour4 hours there and back so that meant i had 8 hours to sleep or studyso i barely get any chance to revise especially since i know im smart i got straight 7s a in my mocks before this unfolded so its so frustrating since i didnt do too well in my last mock due to my parents death a few days before my 2nd mocks started now im struggling to stay in my high sets then theres my social life as i said its hard to do anything since i live far my original town around an hour away side track i used to be really overweight but due me being bullied as a kid and then my crush making fun of me motivated me to lose weight age 1385kg to age 1451kg which i was proud off but that routine got destroyed due to me moving into foster i gained weight and now im age 15 2 months away from 16 65kg and one thing that annoys me is that my aunty couldve taken my she had a high paying job but she didnt want to take care of kid shes married and has a child she was also a social worker however i forgot to mention it was this women this women who i confided in someone i though was my hope she was the one that betrayed me and told my parents about my uncle raping me and me wanting to move out when i turn 18 she betrayed me and made it seems as though i fabricated this lie so i could move out she promised me to wait till i turned 18 so i had a choice in my life but nope she couldnt wait first of all i wasnt the only one raped 2 other kids were also raped by him they both told my aunty but to save face they threatened the other two because theyre still 11 theyre more likely to listen i didnt therefore the reason i was tortured i hate her with all my life my only hope turned into my biggest disappointment police gave up due to the lack of testimony whole family conspired against me in addition to my social life as i mention i was bullied my whole childhood i was a fat kid who didnt know how to socialise becuz my parents always fought or let their frustration out on me mentally or physically and because i wasnt popular my best friend pretended not to know me in school and then supposedly wants to always hang out with me when ever there wasnt school i was still naive then he betrayed me twice in high school i ended our friendship 2 years ago after the 2nd time i trusted him and he betrayed me a few weeks after that i met a new person who was a really good friend that was when his cousin wasnt around his cousin lied framed me racist commentweird even though were the same race but still i didnt even say it i proved it a week later when he posted the wrong screenshot since we had beef showing he said it first and all i did was say the same thing backand what my friend did was support him that infuriated me since i knew he was supporting him and sat next thingwhat makes it even worse was that it was all on his phone i didnt end my friendship with this person but i did drift off from him i then met a person who was a genuine nice person we had a good couple of months but his parents were strict so we couldnt hang out much and weve kinda drifted off but he is still someone i would trust i also met another genuine person he was a new kid and he is now my best friend i think it was weird because i never expected it to happen since he was popular i was just well a student even were close and talk quiet a bit but i always feel uncomfortable with him he never answers me with full sentences doesnt talk to me when were with out group of friends but i do know he cares for me as a friend but a lot of the time i think that if it was purely up to him and by date of chance that we say next to each other is that he never wouldve bothered speaking to me in fact hes probably the only one that would actually hang out with me in our group of friends the thing our group of friends arent like friend but just nice people in my perspectiveits like were friends only when the other person is here if u get what i mean it honestly is so fucked up me i only have what like a month to my gcse and all i am is depressed down i have never once been happy this year actually that was a life the only thing that makes me happy is anime ive developed an anime addiction ever since age 8 this was originally due to my parents fighting and arguing so i went upstairs to watch movies until i stumbled onto anime the only good thing i can think of is that in 2 mo the i turn 16 which means ill be able to rent a flat thanks to my social workers ill be in a new town in a new school ill be in college and ill be able to start a fresh start but still looking how my life is it feels like im meant to have a hard life it doesnt help that im an atheist because that means im not able to rely on someone with 100 belief ive never had a true true friend my education is pretty much ruin im literally on my own my carer only cares about the money and my social worker cant find any more placements its so fucking frustrating honestly is it just that some people have a hard life ive sacrificed so many hours of sleep that my heights been affected and that ive dozed of many time on the busi just cant care anymore all i want now is to become rich and take over the world without any selfish desires i just want to truly make this world better because it doesnt look like anyone is gonna help me ive tried got hurtmany times and all for what edit half a year later into now january 2020in my first year of college my life has gone worse im not in the mood to explain it somehow somehow its gone worse ive been diagnosed with metal health disorder and no one understands me they have bad view of me and when i try to explain they place their authority over me and wont let me talk especially when i have facts my social life hasnt changed my genuine friend with strict parents guess what happened you would have never wouldve guessed facewithrollingeyes he spread rumours about my personal life and left me for another person ive gained weight im back to my weight before my weight

extent this is kinda funny who wouldve though life could get this shitty at such a young age for kid born in a good area who wouldve though not trying to sound pessimistic but i was genuinely kind and generous to all my friends and everyone i meet would suffer like this the good guy gets nothing wow even i cringed when i said that whatever happens in june happens if i do commit id at least want someone to know my story and if they meet someone like me please i beg with all my life help him the one thing i wish i had was someone who understood someone who didnt listen because they had but

i just turned 18 and its hard working due to depression i just turned 18 and i graduated high school in may i decided to not go to college this year because it genuinely made me cry thinking about having to go i know my mental health would get so much worse i had a job but got fired in july and the other day i started doordashing ive barely doordashed because its so scary it gives me so much anxiety and makes me sad all i want to do is lay around everyone especially my mom has been on my back telling me i need a full time job right now i have never been more disappointed in myself in life and it makes me even more depressed is it valid that its hard for me to work right now,1
what are some of the consequences to telling people that i am potentially suicidal im tempted to start opening up this part of myself to my friends and im wondering if anyone else has done this and what the impact was for those relationships something that bothers me in daily living is that i feel constrained and i feel like im always keeping part of myself hidden im thinking that sharing that part of my identity will help me feel more open and expressive i want people to understand and accept that im not happy and im tired of pretending that everything is going to work out and get better im 32 one positive thing thats happened so far is that when you tell people you dont want to live they might share with you their reasons for living that perspective can be helpful and a note that i am seeing a therapist and im not going to kill myself today im just wanting to tell people how i feel about living so i can feel understood idk dont want to frighten anyone,1
does anybody sometimes hope they get sick so they can die without having to use suicide and disappoint other people i just want disappear but i am to scared of the pain of suicide and the meaning which comes with it suiciding also affects all the people who know you why did he do that did i treat him wrong my parents would probably blame themselves and maybe get suicidal getting sick in a way that i couldnt be healed and die would be like an escape from this world,1
the worst part of depression is that its stolen my personality my actual personality is over the top funin my opinion confident and kind but the depression teams up with social anxiety so that i just dont have enough enough energy to act like who i truly am i turn into this very flat monotone boring quiet person who i would never want to hang out with or date its the main reason i avoid social interaction now it feels humiliating because i feel like im perceived as this pathetic pitiable ignorable person when im feeling better and have a little more energy i can act like myself but usually im just this shell its horrible like watching the progression of als in a loved one they just slowly fade away until theres nothing left of who they used to be at least with physical illness or bipolar or whatever you have yourself that fundamental spark of who you truly are and youre able to show that and share that with others i dont even have that privilege sorry if this comes off as arrogant or insensitive this is just how i feel edit guys thanks so much for all the responses i appreciate all of you i didnt know so many people felt the same way and im glad if i was able to help give voice to your struggles ive had depression my whole life so ive had a lot of time to think about these things i think it helps to be able to really narrow down what youre feeling i wish you all luck in getting better,1
stressed and feel like i dont have anyone to turn to i like my work i like what i do but im also overwhelmed i have double the work of my coworkers because im very good at my job but its frustrating because im a bit behind on the files about a week and a half behind now and continue to get more behind as more and more are assigned to me and then one of my coworkers was able to have a full hour person phone call because of the free time he has its frustrating im also in grad school and took 2 courses during summer so i just dont have the time to work ot and get caught up i also cry sometimes when i get overly stressed i also have a few diagnoses bipolar 2 adhd anxiety and borderline personality disorder which im still in the process of finding the right mix of meds there was short period of time where i cried at least once a week the first time my boss had been around when i cried she made me feel like i was too weak to handle the job but continued to assign me files since then i have avoided crying when shes in the office i was talking to my bf tonight kept talking over me and would barely let me get a sentence out and when i raised my voice to tell him he was talking over me he diverted the conversation to me yelling at him instead of acknowledging he was talking over me he said he wasnt talking over me and then called me weak because i cry from work i cant talk to my friends about it because my boss is part of the friend group so i dont want her to think im still weak i have a tendency to change jobs every year and a half so im not trying to do that again i just needed to vent thank you for reading,1
high school hi i searched for many subreddits to let out my feelings and i felt like this was the most appropriate i am currently a senior in high school and worked through an enormous amount of stress and hardwork for the last 3 years i took 12 ap and honors classes was captain of the robotics team on student council and much more there were many many days when i stayed up until 2 or 3 in the morning studying for tests getting stressed out about grades teachers overloading us with home work trying to make my parents proud and more importantly myself proud i went into this school year a happy dude just finished 3 hardworking stressful years of high school and hope to get into at least 1 college that i wanted 2 weeks ago i learned that i got denied to every college i wanted to go to except 1 and i got waitlisteddeferred these past two weeks i have felt useless depressed and most of all stressed out i have had this feeling in my head that just makes me feel like im about to pass out i have felt like there was basically there was no point in doing anything anymore i have just been going through the motions of life on the outside looking happy on the inside just stressed out of my mind i thought i experienced stress before but nothing is like this ive tried so many ways of relaxing but everything just makes me so stressed i sure as hell dont want pity and im not making excuses i just needed to let it all out i didnt really know what to do my parents dont really care that im stressed they just tell me that there is no reason to be stressed i think thats what makes me stressed more than anything the fact that i go to my parents and think they tell me that i can just turn it off like it has an off switch i just needed somewhere to let it out,1

depression turns me into a bitter selfdestructive asshole w no empathy its such a toxic downward spiral my depression manifests itself as chronic indifference loss of interest in doing anything no hopepurpose in life and the general malaise causes me to perhaps worst of all turn into a bitter insufferable asshole everything and everyone bothers me to a much stronger degree i become increasingly judgemental and dismissive of others i lash out and hurt those close to me when i need them most its like im a completely different person everything sucks everyone sucks and i dont want to deal with any of it its incredibly destructive but i honestly cant help myself as im too depressed to even maintain a conversation and feign interest or empathy in anyone to begin with i used to be so charismatic but trying to rekindle that energy again just makes me come off as janky and contrived again im like a completely different person spooky,1

i stayed up all night talking with the most amazing woman i just stayed up all night talking to a woman who is genuinely interested in me we stayed up talking about music and nerdy things like dnd she laughed at all my stupid jokes and was fully invested in everything i had to say as well as having her own thoughts on whatever the subject may be after i thought we were done talking and i was ready to sleep she called me back and we talked for another hour it felt like minutes i havent felt like this in a very long time especially while sober fingers crossed everything works out sorry for bad englishgrammer,0
youre mexican depression is a whitepeople thing we dont have time for that yup this is what one of my closest friends said to me when i opened up about my struggle with suicide and how the previous year i actually tried to kill myself after years of selfharm i dont think i have ever had someone invalidate my feelings so quickly it just makes me laugh now when i hear some peoples ignorance and dismissive attitude when it comes to depression like damn lol anyway have you guys ever gotten a response like this if so share it im sure we could all use a chuckle or two,1
i wake up with nausea every day from stress and want to stop every morning i wake up and my stomach hurts from stress i have a problem that i cant seem to solve no matter what ive tried so far been going on for almost 2 years and i want to just stop thinking about the problem and stop worrying about it but i cant even subconsciously i guess if im trying to focus on something else and i spent half my day just trying to force myself to eat food and calm my stomach and its making me suicidal along with other things wondering if anyone has any tips or strategy for calming nausea caused by stress i saw a doctor about my stomach issues and its clearly just stress,1

passively suicidal does anyone else find themselves constantly just thinking about dying or disappearing and just not wanting to exist but also not committed enough to end things like i find nearly nothing redeeming about my life i know theres good in it but its just not enough anymore so i just daydream about dying so i dont have to pretend to be okay anymore im not planning to kill myself but i find myself wishing i could because this disinterested floating through life is just pointless,1

some thoughts ive suffered from depression for about 3 yrs now and i genuinely want to die but the only reason holding me back is because i dont want my family to fall apart i feel like if i died my family would live on with guilt thinking they couldve done something to help but in all honesty its nobodys fault but mine,1

so i bought myself flowers today no special occasion i just had a tough day at work so i picked up a big bunch of tulips on the way home not the cheap ones either but the lovely fresh perfectly blooming crisp and colorful kind whats the big deal youre probably thinking the big deal is that there was a time in the not so distant past that the thought of treating myself to anything just because filled me with guilt shame and self loathing you dont deserve it its too good for you youre not worth the timeeffortmoney you are nothing and you have nothing to offer so you deserve nothing in return so now i really appreciate any small act of kindness i afford myself yes there are still days that i force myself to have a cold shower in the morning just because i hate it i love cooking delicious food for other people but i still sometimes eat instant noodles when im alone and having a bad day because its a waste of time to cook just for me but today i showed myself a little kindness i acknowledged the fact that i work damn hard and i am great at my job i have value and i am valued tulips are beautiful and so am i i deserve to have beautiful things in my life because i am a badass bitch edit wow thank you everybody honestly i didnt expect much of a response to this i was just giving myself a little pat on the back for not being a dick to myself for once lol im so happy it put a little smile on a few faces and even happier if it reminded even one of you wonderful people to be a little kinder to yourself youre all awesome and to the lovely stranger who gave me gold thank you from the bottom of my heart for that it was a nice surprise to wake up to this morning and put a little pep in my step today,0

easily stressed so i get stressed quite easily and find it difficult to cope with pressure and difficult situations i also find that when such stressful situations happen i tend to blame myself for them and get really down and negative about myself i get quite worked up about it that sometimes end up having mental breakdowns and let it all out by having a good cry i dont know what to do to be more resilient and deal with it better so it doesnt affect me so much because its affecting my mental health and making me feel worse about myself,1
im getting more and more stupid for a while now i feel like i am getting progressively stupid information doesnt stick common sense doesnt kick in and overall i really struggle following conversations and responding correctly im always lead in bed at night cringing about stupid things ive said things i should of said how slowly ive been to react to something and overall how useless i am i feel like im turning into a sloth my body is so heavy and every now and then i have to kick myself up the ass to get a move on because ive blinked and ten minutes has gone by i dont recognise this mess that ive become and i just wanted to know if anyone else gets this and if so how to get out of it im miserable and whats worse im frustrating for the people around me and getting a reputation of being slow and overall useless help disappointedface,1
everyone is struggling in life and im not even trying without getting in too much detail i crossed paths with an orphan kid who moved to the city to take a chance on himself despite his very bad situation meanwhile i whine to myself about how useless i am without doing anything about it at this point im fake but i dont know where else to put this what the hell is wrong with me,1
i want to die but i dont want to die can anyone else relate to this every day plays out the same way bored out of my mind extremely unmotivated to do anything im sure that if i keep going forward i may reach something that may make me happy eventually but that would take so much work way too much for me how could someone like me achieve something so big when i get tired just from performing tasks required to live i am almost tired 247 wake up get out of bed eat food maybe take a shower ok ive had enough for the day already ive already realized that in the end anything that i accomplish in life wont mean anything when i die everything that i did in my life wont matter anymore it might matter to the people that were entangled in my timeline but eventually they will figure out the same thing so its fine they will stop caring as well wherever darkness manifests itself there is still light i still want to enjoy my life here on earth and in fact i do sometimes i still really care about the people close to me the feeling of love is what stops me from ending it i wish that i didnt have to feel this way but im still a human it pains me that some people care about me because they really shouldnt if they knew how i felt im sure it would pain them i wish others didnt need to feel pain i know that this is definitely not normal but sometimes i feel that my goal is to save everyone from this inevitable suffering i doubt it will happen but some day i think that i would like to build some crazy powerful atomic bomb and destroy earth so us humans would no longer have to feel anything anymore i want to die but i dont want to die yet,1

mind is racing and i cant stop over thinking everything feeling in despair about everyone and everything ive been unemployed for a year after working in a highly stressful job and at the same time coming to terms that i was diagnosed with anxietydepression in the midst of it all and figuring out ive had it since i was 13 but never acknowledged or understood why i felt like a outsider 247 i tend to push people i care about away when i want time to myself even though i hate the distance i dont mean to but i do because i over think everything and my anxiety creates things that arent even there then it manifests into something that is on loop until i just keep sinking and on top of that the depression really just sends me to such a irrational overly emotional and unstable person that cant contain my thoughts and i just completely spiral till i feel so hopeless that i just lay there and cry in frustration this week has really been tough and i dont know who to invest in my best friend who knows about my depression is always there for me but he has found some new friends which i think has triggered me to believe that just like some of my other friends he will just forget about me and decide its all too hard i think thats what i fear because then i will be completely alone and its like losing the light in this dark room that keeps me a float sorry if this is really long it took me 40 minutes to type that as my brain is a scattered mess i tried putting it the best way that i could as it feels like im multitasking 6 things at once if somebody could please help me or give me suggestions on managing things at least id be forever grateful as i am losing myself completely,1

first time writing my thoughts down observations that make me depressed 1 i feel like no one is like me 2 time ends all 3 shitty people own the world 4 life has no meaning unless you like lying to yourself 5 everyone is clueless including me 6 laughing is my only escape 7 love doesnt happen to everyone it should 8 nothing amazing ever happens 9 everyone has a demon they cant escape 10 most people dont help only hate my observations 11 i got lucky with my life compared to most people and that bothers the fuck out of me 12 am i the only one that thinks this way i feel like a crazy person no one ever talks about this shit 13 critical thinking is rare should be standard in 2021 14 death sounds fun compared to living since its something no one knows about 15 i wish i didnt exist yet i love who i am compared to everyone else 16 i lie to myself to feel better but it always fades at the end of the day i wrote this list for me but if it resonates with anyone else then that makes me slightly happy i have been alone with my thoughts of what this world i live in is about for so long and nothing makes sense i just want answers that no one has and it has been eating away at me for years everyone tells me to not think about it and just live your life i cant these questions and observations that i always come back to is all i care about they are the only questions that need an answer who gives a fuck about what to have for lunch when you dont even know why you exist i would be fine if i lived in a utopia of magic and wonder but that is a fantasy that does not exist i am living in hell that others see as normal,1

i dont want to die but if i was offered a chance to erase myself from existence i would take it apologies in advance for the ramble that follows and for any mistakes as this isnt my native language no matter how busy i make myself it all seems pointless in the end what the fuck am i working towards doesnt seem like i have any purpose in life even though im 26 and most people my age are making their careers and starting to settle down anything i do is to distract myself from my thoughts but i end up at the same dark place at the end of every day honestly feel like instead of growing as a person i deteriorated in the last few years i have no motivation left except that i love my parents and them having to witness my death will destroy them if only there was a way to erase myself from everyones memories,1

snuggle her enough she looked at me through facetime yesterday and cried wanting me she just kept reaching for me through the phone and didnt understand why i couldnt hold her im also dealing with jealousy because my exs new girlfriend is seeing her everyday and getting to love on her and hold her and play with her i know that its selfish but this girl wants to be a mother badly and it feels as if shes stealing my baby i know that shes not stealing her but it feels that way i just want her home how am i supposed to do 10 days of this how am i supposed to go from seeing holding her and loving on her everyday to not at all this is so hard my boyfriend has 3 kids that hes across the country from so hes desensitized to it for him its been his life for 2 years so he doesnt understand why its such a big deal he just wants me to magically get better he has his own depression and says that its not good for him to be around someone so depressed which is valid but it still hurts to hear he says that i need to work harder to fix it he says that im not working hard enough idk what he wants me to do in isolation that i havent been doing for years already ive been suicidally depressed since i was a little girl due to be in an abusive home ive been to numerous healthcare professionals and on multiple meds and combinations of meds for years it isnt an overnight fix and i dont think that he understands that he wants me to reach out to people around me and people on facebook and stuff but i dont talk about my mental health issues with people when ive tried in the past people just treated me like i was crazy or expected it to be fixed overnight or very quickly blamed every little thing they didnt like about me on my mental illnesses and then dumped me because of them i became stigmatized very quickly and i hated it its embarrassing to talk about in general a lot of people depend on me and this shows me as being a undependable person thats how i get treated when i mention it at least he openly talks about his mental health to anyone who listens and i worry that he burdens others with it and i dont want to burden others too that gets exhausting for people very quickly he said that reaching out like that is what will fix it quicker though idk why im just an object to be fixed to him when he keeps asking how we can fix it i just want to scream like am i not allowed to just feel it for a second can i not just be sad for a couple days then move on from it and that be okay why is it wrong for me to just cope with it in my own way he asked for me to be more emotional im usually a very logical person as a defense mechanism to hide this part of myself and protect it i dont show emotions to anyone he asked me to because he hated that logical defense mechanism he broke those walls down i warned him about this multiple times he said that he could handle it now every time i have any emotion whether its excitement happiness anger or depression he says that its too much for him to handle he distances himself from me i tried to express that to him and he actively denied doing it he said that hes just communicating its great that he is but hes confirming that i am a burden by doing that why ask me to be emotional if you cant take those emotions on why offer support only to wrench it away so suddenly when i need it most hes so supportive and loving with all of his friends and takes every emotion of theirs in stride with his own he sometimes puts me on the back burner to do so why can he do that with them but not me why can he just so readily be there like he promised without trying to just fix everything but not do that for me why am i just something to be fixed why am i the one thats too much for him he says that im sad all the time i pointed out that the majority of time that im chipper and happy and high energy and he hates that he says that its too much which forces me to either be neutral or have a negative emotion he just brushed by that statement and never addressed it like what does he want from me here i feel like i cant win im just struggling and need someone and he promised to be that someone and now it feels like hes dropped me in an ocean after trying to rescue me from it and im drowning i want to go back to not feeling but he hates that too i asked him what the point of me being here is then i asked him what i do for him he says that i give him something to look forward to when he wakes up in the morning idk what to do with that it makes me feel like a warm body to just fill space he says that he isnt ready to go full on commitment and be super serious but weve moved in together in his place because he thought that itd be a good idea we said i love you only for him to recently admit that he said that out of an intimate love for me but he isnt in love with me he doesnt want to be serious but then he keeps trying to break down my walls and expects me to just pour all of my emotions out to him even though he cant handle it he doesnt want anything but also wants everything and im going through emotional whiplash idk how this turned into a rant about him i just im depressed and im not doing good and he is my one form of support and ive lost it i just want my daughter home and in my arms i guess that this whole thing is just a rant im just gonna walk back inside with a fake smile on my face i guess so that he can think that im magically better whats ironic is he told me to open up to people and that my fears of what theyll do is just stigma and unfounded but hes doing the exact thing that i was scared of this entire time he essentially proved me right im all alone and no one will ever be able to help me thanks for reading if you have any tips for getting out of this depressive rut until i can get a new psychologist and new meds youd be my knights in shining armor rn im on zoloft and buspar at the highest doses but they make me feel drunk and i cant take those while caring for a daughter even though they do work outside of that if you have any medication recommendations as well id love to hear them thanks again,1
a stranger on the beach just gave me money to buy ice creams for the group of young people i was with and walked away im an italian volounteer working in france for an association that helps young people without family to get indipendent theyre mostly migrants from africa and arab countries that need housing getting regular documents to legally stay in the country finish their studies and find a work due to covid we didnt do many activities and we were left with some extra budget so we decided to spend it for a trip and yesterday we brought them to the beach we were a dozen seven teenagers from several african countries three from pakistan me and an educator as soon as we arrived we immediately went into the water me being a little thin and suffering the cold from the water more than other people got out earlier than the others and went back where we left our stuff not a minute after i got there a guy came to me asking something it went like that him are you supervising that group there pointing at my young ones playing in the water me yes at that point i expected some kind of bad remark and instead him we are leaving tomorrow and i wanted to give you this to spend for getting them ice creams and he lent me a 50 euros banknote i didnt really know what to reply on the spot and just told him a thank you very surprised he didnt wait for more and just left he had his towel a little further he packed his stuff was joined by who i guess were his wife and daughter and went away he didnt ask if i was working for some association who the young ones i was supervising were nothing he didnt even wait for giving the money when everyone was present he just made this selfless act and departed on the way back we bought everyone ice creams and i ended the day with a really great feeling i think it was the nicest most spontaneous thing i ever happened to see from someone,0

condemned the clock is moving too fast i am young but i feel old very old i destroy everything that i touch and do nothing very constructive i have someone i share my life with who has difficulty understanding how i may be feeling and i feel guilty i feel guilty for making her go through all these shitty times and making her life hell i live badly with it sometimes im even having delusions about saving my loved ones im afraid to come out of my depressed nest lets say to find job or friends or even a simple feeling of normalcy would bring me satisfaction and ultimately be wrong it would be the straw that broke the camels back i imagine that i will have to learn to live with these conditions all my life from the bottom of my heart thank you,1
does anyone else kind of fantasize about killing themselves when they get really stressed so im really not a depressed person at all probably more the opposite but when i am in a really stressful situation at work especially when i mess something up i honestly feel like killing myself i wouldnt do it because i have a wife and kids but can anyone relate to this feeling its especially strong when i feel like im not good at my job,1
i feel like ive won the lottery of life i live in a beautiful city that most people vacation in i finally went back to school full time for a degree i think ill enjoy i can fully support myself without working at all and dont rely on anyone to take care of me i have more than i ever imagine i would in life i really didnt think i would be alright my parents even told me they had almost no hope for me and didnt think id make anything of myself i have done well enough in 10 years that ill never be forced to work again unless i decide i want to i have no idea how i even managed that as it was never my intention i looked in the mirror this morning and couldnt stop smiling i feel so blessed and am so proud of myself for never letting anyone stop me or hold me back im so happy,0
acknowledge the building stressors in your life as you age there will be more and more stress learn about this before its too late i am in my early 30s i just had a birthday of a significant number to me i had a crisis im still recovering from it life is getting more and more and more stressful ive had the same job for 6 years and its increasing too and my workload is starting to get to me ive lost the ability to relax so its hard to distract myself in the evenings we recently moved into a bigger house with roommates so theres more responsibility there you might notice that your functioning breaks down it becomes harder to do things that were once mindless and ordinary might even be hard to eat thats burn out its a terrible place to be and it just gets worse if you have a mental disorder like me then stress will hit you harder im working to collect all of them is what i joke to my friends in a maybeimbeingserious kind of way if you have a mental disorder like me itll be hard to regulate stress your mind wants to go at its own pace and theres a pace forced upon you that your mind doesnt like to follow but in order to survive you must follow it you need to find your own pace and go at that pace as much as freaking possible ive realized on that birthday mentioned above that its damn hard to rediscover your own pace when youve become so used to existing in overwhelming stress we become zombies on autopilot to prevent stress from affecting us at every moment we lose connection with life existing merely as creatures of survival this can change but it is also very hard therapy helps medication can help routine helps create whatever patterns you can that reinstill a passion for life patterns and routines make you feel in control you are in control but control is hard to work up to im working up to it i feel weak but im so damn strong for making it this far and so are you so dont let stress win find your pace instill a peace in routine slowly work your way up that mountain like a mountain climber with no gearand find resting points where you can release your hold and simply rest stop and take deep breaths randomly throughout the day break the fourth wall and look around you and realize youre in life in that very moment the destination is not that thing youre doing this evening or this weekend but that very moment whether its in a line at work in traffic talking to an annoying old acquaintance on the phone or whatever thats the moment some moments feel better than others but your mind is capable of making meaningful moments no matter what youre doing embrace that truth life can be worth it,1

hi i dont want to live and i want help this is my second post here and this might be kinda long because theres a lot to get off my chest but recently ive broke up with my girlfriend about a week ago due to falling out of love with her out of the blue admittedly wed been arguing quite a bit but it wasnt anything too crazy i just felt kinda emotionally drained and i just havent been able to get attracted to any other girl since this ive always been into women my whole life obsessed over them in school and would be on my mind 247 naturally after feeling like this for the first time ive questioned whether maybe im gaybi and i dont seem too into men although i also have an extremely low sex drive rn so i guess its kinda hard to tell whether im into gay stuff or men now or not but basically i just want to die because everything was going perfect with this girl and now im either not attracted to anyone or im gay either way my life is completely ruined and i feel like theres nothing to live for anymore if im gay or asexual im just not the same person anymore and my whole life plans are gone idk what to do every day im stressing about whether im attracted to women still or whether im attracted to men now so my sex drives low from all the anxiety and sadness ive been dealing with but i cant raise my sex drive because my anxiety wont go away about whats going on with my sexual preferences etc etc has anyone else gone through something similar or have any ideas on what to do,1

i feel like i have lost all my skills i dont know how to describe it but i have a crippling depression for a year now and the most noticable thing aside from being sad and suffocated all the time is the gradual loss of my skills in all areas of life i used to be a real smooth talker but i realized that my lingual skills have almost deminished sometimes when i talk my mind suddenly blacks out and i have no idea what to say next or totally forget what should i say i struggle with basic math problems i feel like i have lost all my critical abilities i do not really have an opinion about anything or any belief towards a certain thing i dont go into discussions anymore because i know very well that my mind does not work well and will struggle after a sentence or two i cant watch movies like before because i struggle with following the dialogue names plots and just have a big headache trying to even understand basic storytelling does anyone struggle with this side of losing skills especially the lingual one,1
how to survive christmas sorry in advance for any mistakes english is not my first language for as long as i can remember christmas has always been a time of very intense feelings for me ive always felt the christmas holidays to be an overwhelming and stressful period of time basically the exact opposite of what holidays are supposed to be like my parents also reinforced this by making the christmas stuff last for days by this i do not only mean the actual celebration but also the seemingly endless time you have to spend with the same people over and over again including the same old political arguments and the forced gatherings of relatives you literally never have to see except for this time of the year even without all this family stress christmas itself the beginning of a new year and also my birthday also happening at the beginning of january are times when i feel low no matter what happens i always feel like i havent even nearly accomplished as much as id like in my life and ive never even once in my life felt as happy as you probably should feel for christmas or your birthday i feel like theres this mutual agreement all over the world that this is the time of the year the time of your life and simply the time where you should feel best and some magic miracles happen and your life upgrades itself to next level i know its unrealistic and probably an unhealthy way of thinking but it seems like subconsciously this thought is stuck with me this whole thing stresses me out intensely every year but this year its especially bad or maybe its been that bad the years before and i just pushed it out of my mind the point is its gotten to me physically and ive had a cold for basically a month now and the last few days my backs been extremely stiff and sore which is something that usually never happens im panicking intensely even thinking about going home to my parents place for christmas next week and i dont know to get through these daysweeks without feeling like ill go insane any minute i hope this is the right sub for this problem and i appreciate you reading this far and if you have any tips for making christmas a bit easier even better,1
i dont know how to word myself right and im pissing off everyone around me im really wound up right now its actually making me feel a little bit lightheaded its like im full of impotent rage and i dont know of a proper outlet for it i frequent several forums online lately im starting to notice that im pissing off everyone on this site and i dont know how to change my behaviour to make it better its like when i try to discuss something like a movie or tv show i find i can only be negative and i cant even critique something properly all i can do is say some variation of i dont personally enjoy x anything i try to add further is quickly picked apart and im forced back to saying that i just dont like it it makes me feel vapid stupid dumb i just want to contribute to the fucking conversation but i dont know what to say i dont know how to be positive and people who read the things i write normally get the wrong impression its so lonely and alienating,1
why do i feel uncomfortable without stress okay so ive realised im usually the type of person thats always stressing over something or a another and that i have obsessive paranoia recently ive started a side job delivering newspapers and found myself singing along to music happy and not stressing thats when it hit me my brain automatically started to think why are you so happy have you forgot that thing that could happen and cause so many problems or im way too happy here i shouldnt be feeling like this somethings going to happen that takes away all your happiness my wife says i feel more comfortable stressing as im used to it but when i let go of that stress my brain panics as its used to having loads going on at once rather than being in the moment happy,1

not sure if i should call a doctor over my work stress hey all so i work in the social housing sector within the uk its a really demanding area to work with a lot of vulnerable clients needing particular arrangements that arent always straight forward and particularly a large volume of requests and queries that feels never ending which i guess is the nature of this sector having a demanding customer base makes it difficult at the moment the team i work in is literally disintegrating in front of my very eyes our manager left a month ago this was after two weeks signed off for stress ultimately making the decision that he couldnt continue to do the job anymore following that our team leader then also went down with stress and is yet to return after being signed off again to make things worse two of our colleagues out of four are also leaving by the end of this month bringing us down to two staff left we on average are getting around about 5060 emails an hour to our team inbox and im getting around 1030 in my personal inbox we also get jabbers instant messages and these are also relentless its also worse because i live in a block managed by the social housing provider i work for and following lock down and me being a type 1 diabetic ive obviously been working from my flat which naturally then followed onto having to use my personal mobile to call customers and contractors meaning this is now ringing constantly ultimately i am starting to feel like i cant relax at home its becoming an office to me and i have no where else i can work as others have suggested working in a different room for example and again to make it worse our team is currently under review for lack of productivity were trying our best but were just literally drowning doing tasks that really dont sit with our team but because im just an admin the head of my departments actual words no one will listen so im now experiencing i think anxiety over the future of my job i know that i nearly had a meltdown on sunday following a week off simply over the thought of what was waiting for me in my inbox for monday morning i was throwing things crying i cant really remember but know that my downstairs neighbour messaged me to ask if i was alright as she heard the commotion i covered up by saying i hypod naturally alongside the horrible situations i have going on in my job i am also the sole carer for my mum who is depressed and anxious and makes at least 2 or 3 attempts on her life a month she was in icu over christmas so i spent my christmas alone with her on breathing support in a ward at our local hospital so my symptoms at the moment feeling hot when i wake up before work sometimes hot and sweaty at points during the day getting really confused over emails where usually i would know to take a step back breath and look at it again i get overwhelmed now and lash outget angry at whatever it is struggling to eat before lunchdinner time i no longer feel hungry in the morning just bloated higher blood sugars than normal in the evening and morning but seem to be dropping around mid day but that may be down to not being able to eat not quite sure what the connections are between stress and diabetes ive been pacing a lot talking to myself on occasion as well which is starting to scare me a bit when i talk to myself its always me having an argument with a colleague in my head but talking it out im worried i am literally losing it massive lack of energy all i want to do is sleep but on the other hand im actually falling asleep fine i just dont feel rested no matter how long i actually sleep for my rls restless leg syndrome has been going crazy constantly goes while i work and its getting harder and harder to stop it only just noticed im doing it right now getting general feelings of being hatedisolatednot wanted by colleagues and friends in the business and its becoming an internal battle where i am fighting the idea of it being true but im starting to feel im losing that battle ive withdrawn from most if not all social events the business holds and prefer to lock myself in my flat unplug the internet and just sit quietly sometimes in the dark i have cried a few times as a result of nasty emails feeling harassed by colleagues even though theyre not really harassing me theyre doing their job of chasing me for updates but it feels so relentless and like i cant get any help from anyone or can approach anyone to talk about how im feeling i fear if i do they may just dismiss me anyways diarrhoea in the mornings on occasion can be really severe and foul but clears up by mid afternoon im starting really early in the mornings around 56am where i can get up in time to get a head start and combined with not feeling refreshed after a nights sleep im drinking lots of coffee far more than normal sorry to waffle on its just ive recently used my doctors time for a couple of infections and some help quitting smoking and im aware of how busy medical staff are during the pandemic so i dont really want to waste my doctors time is it worth me ringing them what would be the options id get back do the above sound like symptoms of stress and are there any other diabetics here that have suffered with stress and if so how did it impact your management of it i guess im more anxious about everyone thinking im skiving but im used to that i felt it the last time i had a hypoglycemic despite the fact everyone saw me black out and told me not to come in the next day so i could rest up still spent the hold day feeling uncomfortable just really dont know what to do i just want to cry and turn my computer off i really dont know if i can do it but i also know i can do it if that makes sense i moved roles last year in the same business and after just about a year in this area of the business i just question my ability whereas i never did before in my previous two roles sorry and thanks,1
i cant seem to cry when i need to for the longest time ive remembered crying freely when needed this crying could be in response to sadness fear or anger but now that i am in highschool i cant seem to cry unless i am talking to someone the issue here is that i dont want to cry in front of anyone i wish i could cry alone without the discomfort and guilt of doing it in front of someone instead when i am going through something that i feel like i should cry about all i can muster is a blank stare into space as i stare i begin losing awareness of my environment while i become increasingly anxious and existential why does my brain substitute brain spotting for crying if this is healthy then why does it feel so frustrating and unnatural this is not to say i am frustrated whilst staring off because i am actually very comfortable in this state of numbness and hyperactive thought it is before and after the fact that i become angry and increasingly sad at the fact that i cant have that hormonal relief that comes with crying,1
as of today im no longer a depressed teenager now im just a depressed guy in his twenties this sucks,1

how to take life less seriously hi all i 24 m am new to this sub but i think i am in the right place for this post basically i have had an absolute shit year last june i lost my father suddenly to an overdose we didnt know this at the time we only found out months later and it came as a shock because we had no idea he even had a drug problem to begin with anyway his death caused a massive ripple effect in our family and being his oldest son i have had to step into some big shoes i found myself caught in between drama involving my dads mom and my own mom while also having to be there for my younger brother 19 my parents owned a restaurant and following my dads death the building landlord forced us out because he wanted the building for himself so after learning the results of the toxicology report we had to scramble to close the restaurant down and get out of the building before the landlord tried suing us again to help my mom with the restaurant closing i had to leave my job which i hated anyway and now i am applying to dental school another very involved and stressful process while looking for a new job long story short i just feel like there are a lot of people depending on me all the time now and it feels like a lot of pressure i constantly feel as though i am behind the eight ball and with each passing day i get more and more stressed out i am just worried that if i cant handle this type of pressure now how will i juggle a career and a family of my own on top of all this i was wondering if anyone had any tips on how to stay in the moment and take life less seriously and enjoy it i find myself putting so much pressure on every decision i make and it ends up stressing me out to the point where i am miserable to be around,1
i keep thinking about how nice death would be floating in the endless void unaware of existence im lying in bed and i cant sleep i feel like shit just like always went to bed 4 hours early because i want today to end ive had experienced romantic love before though it didnt last i dont want to be here without it and i barely want to be here with it what good is any of this if i cant fill the void in my chest love has come close its provided a noticeable fullness before but it didnt plug the hole im not cut out for living but i havent the courage for suicide maybe someday ill go to sleep and not wake up i still love my ex ive moved on but i miss her today i wish i could say she still loved me maybe i would be able to sleep tonight,1
anyone elses depression going into overdrive with the recent seasonal changes i was doing great all summer wouldnt even say i was depressed just a few weeks ago but with the clouds coldness late sunrises and early sunsets i can feel things starting to spiral particularly i seem to have lost the ability to fall asleep at the right time or sleep through the night my schedule is all shifted and im basically just getting sleep in chunks at random times my mood is reflecting my poor sleep i dont know if its sad or if the light changes are screwing with my circadian rhythm but i dont like it i think depression for me tends to be a very physical affair body pain muscle tension sleep disturbances it always seems like this stuff comes first my mood issues are more insidious im generally pretty rational and emotionally reserved and dont tend to feel emotions super strongly in one way or another so it sneaks up on mea slow creeping apathy and anhedonia i tend to get pretty deep into it before i realize how bad things have gotten think im going back on the zoloft,1
i feel beyond suicidal anybody else have this suicide just feels completely pointless infact everything does people try to cheer you up and all they do is tell you to be practical and to stop being dramatic when youre not even showing any emotion the first place and all youre doing is lying there like a dead fish killing yourself is just another desperate solution to something that cant be fixed and even then suicide doesnt do anything except cause more pain to people not even dying seems appealing anymore at this point i just want to lie in bed and sleep and keep sleeping and keep sleeping but i cant even be afforded the option of giving up if i do people tell me im selfish and stick pitchforks in me i ask why and the best answer i get for keeping going is just because you have to and then people get angry when you press them further because they cant really think of a reason either its just a blind desperation to survive we all have like were just that important that need to survive other people have seems to have disappeared from me and so has the need to die im stuck here in this place and all i want to do is block it all out sometimes i dont even want to get out of bed to piss we keep going because we have to but nobody ever tells me why edit wow 13k upvotes and an award this is the first post ive ever made here on this sub and youve all made me feel really welcome so thank you very much im glad so many people get it i knew i wasnt the only one out there who felt like this but to see the amount of traction this got and just how many people understood this makes me feel so much less alone i wish i could thank each one of you individually thanks for being there reddit 3,1

i honestly cant tell if im depressed or lazy as shit hi everyone using a throwaway to avoid identification as i 19f write this im on the verge of tears and have a lump in my throat for no discernible reason before this i spent the whole day lying in the same spot watching tv save for the one time i got up to make myself instant noodles at dinner i started tearing up because i was disappointed with the food this is kinda embarrassing my mum keeps asking me why im always lying down not in a malicious way or anything and i cant really pinpoint the reason but im always unexplainably exhausted the good days are fine and sometimes really good but the bad days like today just really suck i feel like i am suspended in time and everything is in slow motion i have wasted yet another day for some context im in a transitional period in my life graduated from high school waiting to start college in october ive had some moments of euphoria here and there that made me feel at the top of the world got accepted to some really good schools etc however for the most part nothing really excites me this is a real low compared to my last 2 years of high school consistent high achiever top student for a bunch of subjects you get the gist during which i felt some degree of fulfilment because i kept getting told i was good at things i notice that when im not occupied by the hustle and bustle of school i always get like this more intensely than otherwise like during summer vacations another thing every single friend of mine has been motivated enough to get a job and do stuff that excites them ive barely done anything the only 2 things i managed to bring myself to do in the last 3 months were the result of me being talked into them by various people i am a major pushover so obviously i ended up doing them i just cannot bring myself to apply for a part time job because everyday i just go i am tired and ill do it another day i feel like shit because i dont know if i have a problem or if my problem is just that im lazy my head is really heavy as i write this so i apologize for my streamofconsciousness writing style the reason why im so confused is that when i am in social settings im really lively and fun im also a very typical gifted kid overachiever with much less to worry about that my friends who are on the edges of their seats trying to figure out what to do in the future and shit i have a loving family and supportive friends i am grateful for everything i have but i just get extremely blue and temperamental for no reason sometimes i dont dare to discuss this with anyone i know because nobody would expect this from me i dont know if this information helps but i typically feel like this during long holidays basically if people arent giving me responsibilities i cant bring myself to do anything im so sorry i dont have the ability to organise this coherently right now but could anyone share what depression can feel like or at least give me a reality check if i really am just lazy and melodramatic some clarity would be amazing please be as candid as possible because if it really just is an attitude problem at least i can stop being selfpitying and start doing something about it just a disclaimer i have never seriously considered suicide but from time to time i wonder what it would be like to just disappear dont worry about me being a danger to myself because i would never do it that was a really long post if you read to the end thank you edit ill be deleting this account soon but before that thank you everyone for the kind words advice and suggestions it means the world to me and im going to try to act on your advice 3 take care of yourselves,1

can you be stressed without even knowing it hey everyone i am just curious can you be stressed or anxious without even knowing it for example for the last 3 weeks i had this tingling feeling around my chin and bottom lip so i did the number 1 no no and googled it well according to google i might have advance cancer and dying in less then a year that caused me to stress out and think what if i am not around for my kids to see my kids grow up so i called the doctor and i have an appointment with him on tuesday but he sent me to get a blood test in advance which all came up perfect except for cholesterol levels so after the blood test results i think my anxiety lowered but every often i still feel the chin tingling so back to the question can you be stress or anxious on something without realizing thanks for the advice just an update my doctor doesnt think my chin is anything even though i still feel the tingling feeling even now he said give it another month and then we will go for an mri is it possible that stress of me worrying has been causing this symptom and if so it cannot be healthy having stress symptoms for like a month thanks for the advice,1

anxiety causing head pressure faint feeling has anyone dealt with daily head pressure from stressanxiety that has lasted many months 247 and it does not respond to over the counter medication since october of last year i have been dealing with head pressure brain fog lightheadedness faint feeling pressure behind eyes etc that has limited me to basically doing nothing every day due to feeling out of it i have went to neurologist ent eye doctor hospital twice gotten lab work such as ct mri mra and mrv of the brain and every scan is clear and every doctor cant find anything these symptoms all came on during an insanely stressful time at the end of last year due to covid and more since they have on they are 247 all the time and nothing has touched them or calmed them even slightly nothing makes the symptoms better or worse is it possible that my head is just in a viscous cycle where it is constantly tense or in fightflight and its just stick in this terrible loop causing these symptoms all the time i feel as if the anxiety comes from feeling these symptoms but maybe it is causing them and its a viscous cycle thats just on autopilot subconsciously has anyone dealt with this and if so what has helped you what is the best anxiety medication for this would benzos for a short period under care of a psychiatrist help break this cycle any help is appreciated,1

the night i had my first kiss ever and everything leading up to it so as ive said before in other posts on other subreddits i have a very close group of friends that ive known since kindergarten and first grade theyre like my own little family and idk where id be without them but out of all them the one who ive known the longest aside from my best friend is my now boyfriend he first asked me out to our end of year school dance for our graduating class about a month before it happened i thought at first he just wanted me as his date which i was totally down with but then he kinda sorta implied he wanted to actually take me on a date sometime i was a mixture of confused and full of butterflies i didnt even really have feelings for him at the time sure hes one of the people i trust most in my life and who has always been there for me when i needed him and sure id always found him cute and kind of goofy but i never found myself liking him like that but seeing how nervous he was just trying to ask me out made me realize how much he must have cared about me and made me feel special so my dad and even my stepmomtobe theyre engaged took me dress shopping and the night of she did my hair for me i cant really describe how i felt looking at myself in the mirror but it was like i didnt recognize the person in it i never put this much effort into my appearance before and couldnt believe it was me i didnt cry or anything but i did think about my mom and realized how much i looked like her especially with how i had my hair done even my dad said that i guess just by pure coincidence the way my hair was done was how my mom looked on their first date so we got to the dance and of course all my friends were there as well all of them complimenting each other on their appearances but as soon as i walked in they all turned their heads and made me feel even more angelic the night went on and we all just loved being in each others company and couldnt believe we were all about to start high school soon but then of course the slow dance came up andwell needless to say neither of us knew what we were doing and had to look at everyone else lol on top of being this close to him even just him having his hands on me and the way we were both smiling at each other it was here when he really told me how he felt about me no i love you or anything like that but just him telling me the things he was feeling how beautiful i looked how long hed had feelings for me all that stuff i myself was at a loss for words hearing someone talk or even care enough about me to say these things i almost thought this was all a dream and wasnt really happening so overcome with so many emotions but then out of nowhere something inside me just said to go for it and i kissed him he looked at me like i had two heads and we both laughed and we kissed again after the song ended even just writing this has gotten me excited lol this was back in may and were officially dating now we have also since said we love each other and honestly im probably the happiest ive ever been my daddy of course says he doesnt like him but i know hes not 100 serious hes usually let him come over to the house or let me go to his i also love how we have completely different personalities and interests yet cant stand being apart for long hes always been quiet and introverted but im usually outgoing and love talking to people if i had to point out one thing i love about him most itd probably be his laugh because hes usually so quiet when he laughs or even chuckles it takes me by surprise every time but thats all i felt like sharing for now thanks for reading,0
new environment stress i moved to another place in 2020 i didnt care much for the change of environment and its not like i cared much for my old school but the thing is while i was in quarantine early 2021 i had developed an unstable emotionality state i became more sensitive and yk that stuff when i finally enrolled in my new school it didnt help shit all they did was give me assignments on top of assignments while i was still trying to fix my emotional stability it didnt help anything i hate it here everything is so different from where i was born and lived there for all of my life i havent made any friends and all my teachers just rule me out as the new student who is lazy and dumb even though im trying my best to keep up after losing one year of education to quarantine my mother never asked about how i felt before ever deciding to move all of us all the way here,1

you ever get asked the where do you see yourself in five years question in a job interview or something and have to stutter because probably not alive is the kneejerk response first off what a stupid fucking question to ask anyway what do you want to hear as the interviewer when you ask that question that im indifferent and stagnant enough to stay with your company that long assuming you hire me or that im ambitiously arrogant enough to in five years plan on being well passed this shit fuckin hell man undoubtedly there are varying degrees of suicidality just as there are reasons for doing it all depends on the person i suppose im the sloth suicidal ive tiptoed through and around depression for the better part of my conscious life and i cant help but feel miserable an overwhelming percentage of the time yet when the obvious solution to this conundrum of despising being alive is well dont be alive anymore the meddling safeguards of thinking about the wake of my actions swelling over everything and everyone i leave behind effectively whiteout any sort of blueprint i have for seeing myself out of my life sounds rather counterintuitive but id rather my last thoughts be more you gave it a go youre not doing anything wrong you do you kiddo and less hey youre a tremendous asshole for this i hope you know that i can comfortably say im not doing it tonight or tomorrow or this year or even the next but i genuinely feel like thats how im going out pending the absence of a freak car crash or lightning strike or some shit dont even really know what im trying to say here but do you ever feel like this like life is essentially an existential clusterfuck that you want no part of but for whatever fucking reason just cant make any sort of move afterthought cant help but laugh that when driveling on in this post i look up at the browser tab and it says submit to depression haha fuckin a,1

i am just a huge disappointment hello just wanted to make a post because today was a pretty sad day for me i woke up this morning and went to the bathroom as its usually the first thing i do every morning and when i walked out i overhead my dad talking to my sister about not ending up like me obviously this hurt and usually i dont cry much but this morning i cried like a bitch hearing my dad say that to my sister really fucking hurts ugh he says that he loves me but sometimes i dont know how true that is i just wish that i didnt exist ive been depressed for years and nothing has changed i have lost nearly all my friends because im a complete loser who is addicted to smoking pot because its the only thing that can temporarily cover up the sadness im starting college soon and my parents dont have any faith in me and honestly i dont have any faith in myself i could barely pass high school because i have 0 motivation how in the world would i be able to pass through college i dont know how much longer i can take this shit ive seen a therapist but she just told me and my parents that my internet use was the problem like really she was completely useless and i havent seen one since i live in a nice house in a nice neighborhood and i have everything i could want a gaming pc a high end smartphone a puppy and life still is just as mundane as usual the only thing i have to look forward too anymore is smoking a bowl at night fuck im starting to get suicidal thoughts and this is becoming really scary i dont really know why im making this post i just wanted to get it all out i guess im just tired of being a lonely loser who has 0 skills i guess,1
can gut problems induce stress i have severe stress problems that need to be addressed in the sense that whenever i get a little stressed about something or i am excited snout something i get severe anxiousness i cant sleep at night get a racing heart or severe stomach ache and nausea i started mediation to get my emotions in a control range lately however a new thing is bothering me so whenever i get severe stomach ache due to say gut problems or period cramps i end up getting a racing heart clammy hands and a dry throat for no apparent reason can the stomach ache induce stress itself,1

waking up every morning with thoughts like i wish i could kill myself replayed over and over does anyone else have this i wake up most days now with an intense anxious despair that compels me to repeat a phrase like i wish i was dead or i wish i could kill myself over and over for the first few minutes in the morning this is a fairly recent thing ive started doing its weird because i wouldnt consider myself suicidal i dont explicitly visualise taking my life or anything like that its like a very fcked up coping mechanism,1
constant noise pollution contributing to chronic stress can anyone relate in the last few years of my life in 3 different cities i have somehow managed to live into neighborhoods where they tend to knock down houses to build multifamily ugly looking beatle juice houses that seem to take ages to complete i guess it probably takes a lot of effort to hang up all those light fixtures on the cheap particle board on top of that the places i work are also constantly going under development as the onsite locations from my jobs tend to be in heavilytrafficked areasits gotten to a point where i cant ignore it anymore theres a project that went up to our surprise after a year of living here and no one in our complex has been able to park in front of our unit in over a year this morning theyre working on the street for god knows what reason i know theyre just doing their job but im just venting and wondering if anyone has similar experiences or if im just being too sensitive ive been dealing with a lot of emotional pain recently due to the death of a few loved ones and its been making it very difficult for me to work to begin with after taking two days off and feeling ready to dive back into work i sat down at my desk at home with a cup of coffee and immediately the jackhammers down the alley started i just dont know what to do about this anymore there doesnt seem to be any place you can live with limited income to escape the constant traffic fire sirens and construction work ive been taking my son out for hikes in parks in the weekend and sure that is great for getting away from it all but how the fuck do i continue to deal with this and be productive its almost like even if i can block the noise out my the part of my brain responsible for detecting the noise is still active and irritated unfortunately im a technical writer and find musicpodcasts just as distracting i have tried going to coffee shops and libraries to work but i find those environments hard to focus and dont want to have to go out of the way of my own house just to get some quiet i meditate daily run and do light yoga which helps me find peace of mind but im finding of 8 years of this constant noise to be harder and harder to take restless in seattle thoughtabs,1

finals week bit of a rant just wanted to know if anyone else felt the same excuse the word vomit ive been up since 6 30 am for an exam its finals week and anxietystress is at an all time consistent high on top of that our family puppy has been great but i think my school anxiety has trickled in to me worrying over him more than i should and i constantly get overwhelmed with all the things i have to get done i cant even enjoy food because i am always thinking too much and get caught up in the stress of school i literally was eating and saw my puppy sleeping and i immediately said wow hes depressed isnt he when hes just sleeping i went out to get food totally fine no problem as soon as i got home it hit me again with all the stuff i have to do the pandemic has 1000 affected my mental health especially recently where i dont get any enjoyment of stuff at home because i am always in front of a damn computer screen i used to see home as a place to leave behind stress from school and now i see home as the place where i do everything and theres no distinction between relaxing and school but the one thing i can hold onto is that it is going to pass all of this is going to pass at some point the brain is just rewiring itself because of the situation happening globally its going to be okay the only way to eat an elephant is one bite at a time if this spoke to anyone out there feel free to let me know how youre feeling how are you coping and if theres any puppy pros in the crowd please let me know what you did to help release some of that feeling of wanting constantly to helicopter over them during times of stress when i feel relieved i dont feel any need to check on him constantly or obsess over little things around the house just when i am overwhelmed and then i dont get anything productive done anyways i always remind myself i am not alone and neither are you even talking to strangers about it can be soothing in a way just a little reminder that theres someone else out there in your boat during such a difficult time my counselor said to normalize what is normal during an abnormal time period and also dont forget to tell your pets you love them,1

my automatic psychological response to any kind of stressful situation is just kill yourself and i hate it like literally anything it can be the most minor thing and its either that or the niggling urge to do harm to myself like i am fine i have actually been fine for ages im no longer depressed in my eyes but it is still that automatic response then it makes me question if i am fine after all probably not eta well i certainly did not expect so many people to relate to this whilst it is a comfort in that it seems somewhat normal it does make me a little bit sad to see so many people experience this take care everyone x,1

stressful day spoiler alert this post is mostly venting but any advice or kind words are appreciated after 4 days of waking up unwillingly early in the morning and being unable to sleep again this morning i woke up with a chest on my stomach and tingling in my lungs when breathing deeply as well as general malaise body pain notclear mind but no fever or bad cough or else last weekend i went out for lunch with a couple friends who recently recovered from covid and i have also seen my paternal grandparents and another couple friends since besides sharing every meal with my parents my other grandpa 91 yo still not vaccinated against covid19 is coming back from the hospital tomorrow after undergoing surgery for a tumour and my parents will go there to help set him up as hell require care i am not only unable to go help them but also hit with anxiety of potentially having contracted covid and having passed it to them as well as to my other grandparents andor friends who thanks goodness are all vaccinated plus i am writing my phd thesis which i need to deliver in a month and ive got no time to waste being sick i could postpone but id rather not plus i havent seen my longdistane boyfriend in a month hes supposed to pass by for a few days in a couple weeks and i really need to see him so much that my feverish mind spinning thoughts at 200 kmh was thinking how much id want to fuck him holding him against the wall and suck his dick at least some good thoughts plus my bf and i collaborate on a research projects and another of our coauthors suggested inviting another senior professor to work on the project with us which would help our chances to publish it in a good journal but might reduce our contribution to it i know he and i have somewhat different views on how to manage this issue but i should decide about it soon and i dont feel clearminded enough to do so plus i have been somewhat down in the past months better now and tend to be needy at times so i am also concerned that letting him know i really miss him and need him might make me less attractive in his eyes and he acknowledged hes not very skilled at offering support to me in this instances i have booked a covid test for tomorrow at noon and hope it will go well but anyway better know one way or the other i just hope and know that everything will turn out fine one way or another but i really do feel alone and stressed not even unable to cope with things because i know i can do it but id just wish it were easier to get some muchneeded support especially from my bf who is the most important person id want to rely on wishing for a brighter tomorrow and glad to hear any advice you might have on how to better cope with things as mentioned i have been feeling vulnerable and easily taken down in the past months due to a combination of factors covid jobrelated rejections i am picking myself up but sometimes it still feels hard to cope with all the shit which objectively is not even that bad given the much bigger problems that many people are facing these days,1

low threshold for stress hello people so ive noticed this interesting thing only recently i dont know how it is for other people but i seem to be disturbed or stressed very easily by various things what do i mean by that lets say im laying in my bed relaxing and my relative opens a door of another room i immediately fall into this shock mode for a second my all attention is on that sound and i become sooo aware of that theres no more relaxation another thing i could be relaxing and random noise from idk anywhere happen and then im all awake disturbed tense so i basically want to ask you these forms of stress are they normal or is it a sign of something going on because i never paid attention to that but as i got more aware of myself because of different practices and teachings ive started noticing that when i meditate lets say a random noise outside can disrupt that more relaxed state and bring me to full awarenessstress mode even when im in a safe environment my home so is it totally fine or should i do something about it and if yes what,1

parentified parent with severe depression im a 31 male and at this point id be glad if someone or something would take my life it all went rapidly downhill after i got my first child who is a wonderful little boy now so similarly vital and full of life and energy like i was when i was little everybody used to go jesus christ the energy on that boy i mean everybody now i feel dead for a long time and next to the current situation i feel even worse i was physically parentified by my father fulfilling his beliefs and standards and taking care of his needs when he was terminally ill with leukemia for 15 years he held me responsible for him and as a buffer between my brothers and my mother im the eldest i was emotionally parentified by my mother who couldnt deal with the pain and anxiety of raising children so young and losing herself and doing that with a man with so many problems himself my father was violent distant controlling bullying etc constantly needing my emotional support since i was 6 i realized that this is fucked up when i was 27 and started to notice and address my problems after such an upbringing while being supportive of both of my brothers who ended up in suicidal depression for a while and in addition dealt with my mom who almost died and was in a coma for a while i had a few longterm relationships until now where i never wanted to move in with another person cause ive never had enough personal space myself the relationship im in now started 3years ago we moved in together and that led to suicidal depression at the end of the first year so i managed to crawl out somehow but to realize my adolescent years were all in a depressive haze and i never managed to truly find myself and be myself and fully enjoy life as a young person or as a child now after the baby i feel so alone so tired and so failed finally theres a family i would like to take care of because i want to this time its my own son and i love him so much but ive been stuck taking care of my otherfamily and now im just so wasted mentally and physically if im home im anxious and dont have any personal space and nothing to do just for myself when im at work i fucking hate everybody there cause i didnt have the time to get the hell out of there which is financially almost impossible now i loose connection with my mainly single friends who i despise now in a way and i fucking hate everybody else on the streets traffic and anyone who wants to interact with me with the kid i see my previous family a lot aswell which is so tiring i have a small rented room for myself for which i dont have any time to go to or if im there i just cry and watch the clock to get back in time to deal with baby chores so i feel stuck in the same demonic mental state like with my previous family adding the love and responsibility for my child which makes it impossible to say grow up im out of here my woman is in a similar burnout state so not much support from there its the oppisite i feel i should be the one to support her and i can see how devastating it is for her when i break down which causes in turn so much blame for myself all of which drains me of the little energy i have left so now im in full suicidal mode again and not able to do any of these things mentioned and no time to do anything i known i need to do for myself to be sane which makes me think why bother at all anymore on top of that im ill aswell atm so a total wreck i just needed to get it out i dont know if its the best sub for this but anybody else been there,1

25 years old with absolutely no friends im a 25yearold girl ill just get straight to the point i have no friends no boyfriend nothing somehow i was the popular girl in class im doing masters and i was always surrounded by a huge group of friends all that changed this quarantine i began to see how much i was never really needed in these peoples lives it first hit me on my birthday the people i thought were close to me didnt even bother doing a video call for me or even send anything on my birthday this was in stark contrast to another girls birthday in the group they all had a video call i was told to join made a loving video for her compilation of clips and pictures and had a small virtual party for her this really hurt me and over the next few months i saw them drifting more and more away now this has been the pattern for friends throughout my life my work friends and even school friends these all are people i was immensely close to at one point but now im not in touch with anyone whenever i do try to strike up conversations they just humor me for a few minutes before ending the conversation or other times they are already close with each other as a group and i feel like an outsider another thing whenever i thought i was best friends with someone they instantly replaced me with someone bubblier more extroverted or more fun within months this has happened to me since my school days it hurt me a lot but i didnt speak about it for fear of looking desperate or being ridiculed so i bottle it all in an incident that will be always etched in my mind is something that happened on my 22nd birthday my boyfriend at the time had broken up with me and i was all alone there was a girl who i naively thought was my best friend up until that time i ended up buying and taking a cake to her place in the hopes that we would celebrate my bday or maybe she had something planned for me she did it for all her other friends when i got there she looked surprised and very very much like she pitied me she hadnt even remembered my birthday its come to the point that legit the only people that truly care for me and have time for me are my parents thats it idk what im trying to say with this post is there anyone out there who feels or experiences the same thing as me how do you deal with it edit im literally crying my eyes out with the support thats pouring in and the stories you all are sharing i had no idea there are so many people who feel the same way as me im at a loss for words seriously you guys are the best thank you for making me feel like im not absolutely alone,1
does anyone else get irritated at little things i think i have manic depression because one minute im excited and have a burst of energy and enthusiasm and the next minute everything is pointless hopeless bleak and im exhausted one thing ive noticed in the last year is i get so mad at little things like someone talking too loud or dropping a fry or tripping on something which makes me want to scream or do damage,1
i just confessed my feelings to a girl ive liked for god knows how long and she likes me back yeah basically what the title says i did it like an hour ago i told her i liked her and she just looked at me and smiled and then i smiled and then we both laughed and then she said she likes me too and then we hugged and oh god that hug was amazing and then she had to go so i just stood there celebrating and now im on cloud nine and theres this warm fuzzy ball of happiness inside me and i have this big goofy smile on my face and yeah thats about it,0

life is a chore having to wake up and immediately being struck with this shock of i have to do this all over again have to go to school college university or even work were stuck in our imaginative sociable unsociable life there are no questions to our daily duties as were following the propaganda of what others expect us to be just imagine yourself not fitting into those sets of species we all supposedly have a purpose to fill but what if you dont fit that category where do we go from there in my situation i personally think i am not fit for this world i suffer with a major physical health issue and that constantly affects my mental health similarly my emotional health is just as bad and it deteriorates my motivation to do anything i have no one personal and close that can fully understand my situation i lost the one person i loved deeply and now she is with someone else theres nothing and no one left to live for i hate going to sleep at every night knowing ill wake up again doing the same thing over i hate waking up every morning with this heavy chest pain i hate life and i wish i could give up and end everything,1
feels like im always too much for people i was diagnosed with depression two years ago and ever since then i havent been able to not notice it when it creeps up as a kid because my parents were constantly fighting i would turn to friends for support this became a habit of mine because i had no one else to lean on when things got rough now im in my late 20s and talking to people about my depression just feels like im overwhelming them constantly ive tried so many times to open up to only get one worded responses that really dont do much in the long run i dont expect people to cure me i know regulating is on me and is my responsibility but i just want to be able to talk to someone without feeling like a burden i had a therapist but for financial reasons i havent gone to one in a while part of me really wants to find one again and just say fuck it to the money but i usually just end up forgetting the next day til i end up right back here at this point all i want is for someone to say that they accept me for who i am with all of my fucked up baggage but i know i cant expect that from anyone so i just end up feeling worse about myself i wish i never had this stupid illness,1

i lost interest in almost everything its been 2 years since i moved from my hometown to another city for studies at first i thought that everything would go well but when i arrived something wasnt right i knew that my shyness and introversion would prevent me from living to the fullest and my prediction was right i made some friends of which none seems as a genuine friend but more like people to hang around i was 18 at the time and i never had a relationship with a girl before and this continues up to this day i moved to my hometown a year ago because of the pandemic and things got better coz of my family and friends but my parents keep telling me things like you have to find a girlfriend i dont want to open up to them and im in a phase where i dont get out from my house at all spending all my time on the internet and being lazy not being to do anything my self esteem is lower than ever and i get jealous of people so easily that i cant stand it anymore especially people who are really funny or smart and socially confident i dont like my friends anymore and i always find reasons to make myself feel inadequate and worthless i sometimes feel that i am dumb and theres nothing i can do and that ive lost my sense of humour i keep overthinking and overanalyzing things all the time im almost sure that i have depression but sometimes i wonder if i have social anxiety too what should i do is spending money to a psychologist a good idea,1

how can i improve my stress threshold i get stressed very easily and very quickly loud noises are particular stressors eg someone vacuuming or playing drums i had a particularly stressful event occur today and my apple watch alerted me that my heart rate was at 198bpm my resting heart rate is around 55bpm and often drops down to the 40s so this really scared me is there a way i can increase my tolerance and threshold so that i am not getting stressed so easily i run everyday and the exercise certainly helps my overall mood but i dont feel it helps how easily i get stressed,1
if the moods of normal people fall between happy and sad the moods of depressed people fall between distracted and miserable some days im pretty okay well not really okay its just that theres enough time for me to anaesthetize myself on netflix video games and other shit that doesnt do anything for me it keeps my mind off of things it keeps my mind off of trying to kill myself its pretty much exactly like taking painkillers you know youre not okay and you know the pain will come back no matter what but what matters is that in that moment youre managing to not feel anything and that in itself is a massive fucking success,1
getting burnt out i dont know what to do im currently in university and sturggling to keep up not sure of this is the appropriate page but here is goes im currently in my third year of university im and average student though i want to get that up soon i always turn in my work early or on time i never really study for my classes but i manage to get passing scores anyway i just wanted some advice because ive seem to have had no motivation and ive been turning in most my work in late and not keeping up im class im not sure whats wrong though ive been working out more and eating better i still get moody the first thing i usually do when i get home is just take my clothes off switch off the lights and sleep no major events in my life just constant stress and wasting my time of wondering what i should be doing next rather than actually doing it getting overwhelmed or putting it off everything is just inconsistent im not sure how to get it on the consistent side what can i do,1
this is not where i pictured myself im a 27 year old dude who had a much bigger vision of where i would be at this point in my life i am however thankfully married to a wonderful woman and have been for 5 years i feel as if i have been failing her in the beginning of our relationship i promised so many grandiose things i have provided some but not many of said things i promised a house 2 kids a stable job and or career a degree of some form and more i have not yet provided any of the fore mentioned promises i feel like i may have told her some of that to keep her hopeful in me and by my side the last two years have been especially tumultuous all due to self inflicted wounds im a recovering alcoholic for the umpteenth time 60 days sober i have been fired from multiple jobs because of erratic behavioral patters and have pushed away many of our friends over the past 2 years i am doing my best at the moment i know others have or had it worse but i am not the man i thought id be especially to a lovely woman who has had my back through it all i demand myself to hold true to my promises im done feeling like a colossal fuck up,1

up since 2 30 ive been up since 2 30 stressed with work ive been dealing with stress for a while now and it can be traced back to a few mistakes i made a while ago dealing with these mistakes and facing up to them hasnt been the bandaid ripe off i expected i dont know what to do with the continued stress,1
my philosophy on suicide a little while ago i vented about how unhelpful it was to tell suicidal people about how other people would feel if they committed suicide the main reason being that a person whos in the suicidal mindset will feel worse off because it makes them feel guilty about being suicidal and instead people should put their focus when talking to a suicidal person on that persons emotions i didnt express that very clearly in the last post because i was pretty angry and wanted to get it out though some concerned about if i was gonna kill myself while i appreciate the concern and i have had suicidal tendencies for a while now im not gonna kill myself not for a long time at least thats because i like to create music and stories and shit and at the risk of coming off as pompous im an artist at my core i have so many projects i want to finish and share and i think every time someone creates a piece of art metaphorically speaking they put a little piece of their soul into making it soul as in their energy their experiences their emotions etc im very lucky to sometimes have the energy to create art and i have projects i want to finish and if im dead ill never be able to finish those projects the longer i live the more experiences ill have including experience with anxiety and depression the more my soul will grow the more art i can create the day i finish all of my projects and i have nothing else to give to the world nothing i can create ive created all ive could thats the day i kill myself because ive finished what i live to but if i keep on willingly living ill never run out of stories to tell ill never run out of art to make thats why im not gonna kill myself so dont worry about me but i hope some of yall can take what i say to heart maybe theres something you can keep on living for if you dont know or dont think there is something like that in you you just havent realized what it is yet,1
the worst part of the depression is that feeling deep deep down that the reason youre depressed is because you want to be its just the thought that maybe you know how to be happy maybe all the stuff you read online the stuff your family tells you the stuff you hear from your therapist maybe it all goes somewhere in your head maybe youve seen enough happy normal functioning people that you have some idea of how to do what they do that maybe youve made the same mistakes enough times that you could point them out and stop repeating them its the idea that you know how not to be depressed so if you still are then that means you must want it this way and if you want it this way well that must mean you deserve it and i guess thats probably not true but sometimes sometimes i just dont know,1

thoughts of mine that are irrefutably true to me i think i wanna die so i can fly so far high in the sky and pretend for one moment that this death is my enrollment to what i consider true home and atonement i often dont want to be alive and i derive that from the five words i think i wanna die i dont take this seriously but variably you could argue hilariously far too editorially territorially and multifariously for my own good maybe i should take it seriously but when youre alone sometimes the only home you know is the one weeping in that dome it can become a prison and for that dumb reason youd think itd be treason to turn you towards yourself and point out all the reasons you were never enough but even when youre alone even negative tones can become home,1

when im depressed i want other people very slight nsfw im using my alt account because of the slight nsfw topic put simply the more depressed i feel the more i long for other people most of the time i genuinely cant tell if what i want is just simply a hug from a good friend that will never end or to make love with someone all day long what i do know is that my body just wants the warm touch of someone however that alone confuses me because normally i despise being touched by other people since i dont know what i want my confusion just makes me more depressed and the cycle just continues,1
i envy happy people who smile and laugh a lot and are appreciated by many why cant i be like them joyful and chill i want to be like them but i dont know where or how to start i just couldnt be genuinely happy interested and passionate most of the time trauma and emotional baggage always pull me back whenever i try i hear voices inside my head telling me no you look stupid they d hate you for that see that look in her face she thinks youre stupid dont hell be annoyed i think a happy face doesnt suit me i was born to be sad i look ugly when i smile or laugh it feels awkward when im sweet it doesnt feel right when i care i feel like people would respect me more if i put on a serious face if i dont feel anything but i want to be happy i want to smile and laugh out loud and i dont want to care about what other people think but i dont know how to do that i am really close to giving up i am not happy what am i still waiting for,0

how exactly does stress cause chest pain i recently experienced a lot of stress at work and have been having acute chest pain for more than a week since im also drinking alcohol every evening to reduce the stress i thought the alcohol caused the heart pains so i went to a doctor to find out after a series of tests nothing abnormal whatsoever was found even though i was feeling a strong stabbing feeling in my heart area during the tests normal blood pressure no irregularities in heart beat etc so it was concluded that it is stress related but i still dont get it the pain im feeling is very real its stabbing me in the heart and sometimes im feeling really faint and about to pass out the doctor says it can happen with stress but i dont understand how how can my body feel so bad yet all tests reveal that everything is perfectly normal whats the process that gives pain without physical reason,1

my parents thought i died in my room and were prepared to bust down my door one day when my parents went away for the weekend and i drilled two deadbolt locks to my room why i have no privacy in this house when my brother was angry at me that same vacation he kicked down my door and threw a pail of kitchen garbage all over my room the lock on my door is easy to unlock apparently my parents are able to open it easily and have been snooping into my room when im not there the day before yesterday i had eaten more portions than normal and my dad yelled at me me knocking over dishes and screaming that i ate so much i locked myself in my room and didnt eat anything the whole day after that today i wake up to my parents yelling my name and telling me to respond back i see them somehow unlocking the door in their usual way but the two deadbolts were there that probably was a surprise to them i didnt want to get the police involved or buy myself a new door so i opened the door and yelled at them for 10 seconds before closing the door there were so many things left unsaid i wanted to yell at them for more reasons they only care if im physically dead not dead inside,1
i made myself smile today and hopefully a few others too so for a while now ive made it a mission whenever i visit a cafe to pay it forward im financially comfortable so am happy to share that where i can if im out for coffee maybe once a week when paying my bill i pick another table or customer and anonymously pay their bill i dont say anything i just pay and leave and hope that person or small group smiles a little when they go to leave today at a cafe which wasnt the cheapest place i might add i noticed a table of 4 with a caregiver and 3 intellectually challenged individuals having a meal i asked the cashier quietly to pay their bill as i paid my own as i walked to my car i was really happy and it was purely because of the feeling i had from that moment of doing something anonymously for someone else im posting this not to boast but to share a smile of my own that hopefully was shared by that caregiver when she went to pay her bill,0

im forced to move home into a 1person rental for the first time and my employer throwing us through an organisational restructure at the same time the stress is colossal and i dont think ill find a way out of all this alive what can i do to manage all the stress so the stress im trying to manage is quite the beast ive put it in dot points to help separate each stressor but its still a mess so sorry in advance work has been putting us through a restructure since july 2020 my job doesnt exist in the new structure and im genuinely terrified that i lack the skillsets to do any of the jobs even in a learning capacity ive applied for a few jobs in the new structure to further my career but ive failed to get a single interview to date im terrified about looking outside my current employer as id have to start all over again my skillset has unfortunately only become relevant to the employer im with i graduated a bachelor in information technology in 2016 but its been so long since then that ive actually forgotten most of the programming stuff i did and starting again will put me back into the suicide mentality i think im really shit at it but its all i have and i dont want to go through the additional stress of reskilling or going back to a shitty retail job that will just make me hang myself in 6 months taking an entrylevel job at work also isnt an option as there is no career progression here unless you basically do someone elses job because theyre too shit to do it themselves thats how i got into my current job and i absolutely dont want to go back to answering the phones again backwards is not an option the last batch of jobs in the new structure came out yesterday and finish in 2 weeks applying for these takes about 56 hours each as they want you to write a billion fucking things as part of the application and each jobs application requirements are different from the last i had to move out my situation with flatmates was a risk to my health and immediate safety so i need to jump ship asap due to covid19 noone is moving 01 of homes in my city and surrounding cities available to rent this month as opposed to 10 this time last year meaning every place i inspected had over 30 people apply for them i never heard back regarding my applications fortunately my cousins friend bought a place and desperately needs someone to fill it the rent is higher than what i was looking for by about 100week but due to covid19 the rental market is fucked right now and has driven the rent prices up everywhere in my state in my country he offered me the place but its unfurnished so i need to purchase all the furniture and appliances and organise all the amenities due to my job instability i literally dont know if i can afford anything should i find myself unemployed and burning money to keep myself afloat i didnt want to be in a position where i have to move home and find a new job simultaneously i simply dont have the mental capacity to handle both of these all on my own even with the help my psychologist provides and friends doing their best to help me out where they can im genuinely terrified that its all going to be too much and ill kill myself very soon or later this year if this stress goes on for too long any tips on managing this fucking nightmare my life is right now edit while my employer couldnt pick a worse time to choose to restructure theyve got a contract with a career support service that has helped with resume sculpting and interview preparation but i feel super inadequate and a bit of a lost cause edit 2 my dog of 13 years died this morning so the last 6 months can fuck off and then fuck off again,1
cant find a uni work and life balance im a first year student who is adjusting to independent living i find just walking to the shops and getting essentials soul draining when i see the amount adding up and i accidentally bought out of date broccoli i try to keep a balanced diet because i know i become sluggish if i dont but cooking is so time consuming and shopping for meat veg headache tablets toilet paper etc feels like putting a hole in my bank account and the time spent shopping could have been spent working in some ways it makes me feel accomplished not like a man child who just lives of instant noodles and take aways there are moments when my brain is drained and i just watch netflix which makes me feel really guilty im also making a film with a group in my film studies course and im the script writer which is a lot of pressure were also communicating mostly online because of the pandemic but i dont know if things would be better if this wasnt a pandemic im worried that the people im working with dont like me im often the one whos asking people if theyve done this and that what ideas do they have and so on because of the pandemic none of us have even seen the set on top of that i have to write a pre production piece and read out loud an essay analysing a short story in creative writing im doing a joint honours in a degree thats seen as kind of useless and selfindulgent the arts,1
i need at least one person to see this i have 0 reason to live because i cant care about my obligations to others if you google reasons to live they pretty much all say that they carry on living because they dont want to cause pain to their loved ones i have very little loved ones and i cant express enough how little i give a shit about how sad theyre gonna be when i kill myself there is no way they will feel as terrible as i do everyday at least have the ability to get over it whereas i am condemned to this suffering until i die some other way i think about how my girlfriend will feel if she finds out ive killed myself and i just do not care i love more than anything even more than myself but i want death so badly that there is nothing that convince not to do it now my mum dad brother grandad grandma and literally everybody in my family will be devastated beyond words and i am fine with that because i will have victory for once i will fixed it at the greatest possible cost and im glad their sadness is of no concern of mine when im fucking dead i do not enjoy living as i have stated in other posts i dont care about the little things in life the smell of freshly cut grass isnt a valid reason to fucking live you jackass i may laugh at things that are funny and may enjoy making others laugh and enjoy the company and love of my girlfriend but it just isnt enough i need some other way of relief of my problems if not suicide i am not fucking willing to put in any hard work because i could just kill myself lol i need a giant stroke of luck or a huge incredibly forgiving second chance that will just make everything go away i wish all my problems could just be fixed by some miracle solution and they all say its just hard work that will fix it but no pal its suicide and its a legitimate solution it ends my problems and thats all i want im quite frankly sur people arent just okay with people suicide and that it doesnt happen even more than it does its just such an absolute and perfect solution for everything the only reason people stop is because they feel obligated to others but i just dont have that filter i feel oddly free in the solace that suicide gives me whenever a new problem arises it doesnt affect me anymore because i know that one day i wont have to deal with this shit because ill be dead and buried,1

whether i live or die the world will remain unaffected i wont be missed by more than the two people who i depend on people will continue to justify lifes arbitrary and meaningless cruelty with fantastical explanations they will continue to center their lives around those fantastical explanations by chance of birth some people will continue to live great lives and others will continue to suffer the lucky ones will go through life engaged and curious and the rest will gradually be beaten down by rigidity conformity or cruelty the endless toxic and useless discourse that has come to define online life will not cease the universes countdown to extinction wont stop babies will continue to be born into abuse never having a chance people will continue falling in love every kiss taunting my lonely time on this earth in an effort to fight against meaningless absurdity people will continue to hate and wage war billions of farm animals will continue being bred into existence with all their capacity to feel pain and terror intact only to live cramped and miserable lives that end in systematic slaughter romantics will continue to write music and poetry in an attempt to offset the suffering that has come before them and will continue to come after i cant take this anymore we were all born into hell the lucky ones are the ones who are naive enough to roll their eyes at the preceding sentence i cant believe i was born with the capacity to feel so much only to be burned and tortured for such a long time as to only have the negative feelings left intact i cant believe someone with so many hopes and dreams has no grace bestowed upon him only the same oblivion that everyone is forced to face sooner or later i cant do this anymore i want to scream but no one will listen i cant believe the level of helpless agony that so many of us are forced to endure why just fucking why i havent felt loved and safe in 10 years since i was 17 thats not an exaggeration i cant fucking believe this is my life love used to be my hope my north star but in the words of daughters love is a disgusting thing love is a disgusting thing and the reason its disgusting is because its the trick that continues to propagate this cursed existence,1
i need to get this off my chest i dont care who sees it when i was a toddler ages 2 to 5 i was raped by my father when i was 9 my best friend who was my cousin committed suicide in front of me when i was 14 i was abused sexually and emotionally by my boyfriend then when i was 16 i was abused by my girlfriend im 18 now and im not alright sorry if this is too graphic ive been going to therapy but it isnt helping so i came back here i dont want advice i just want to get it off my chest edit oh my lord this blew up so much more than i thought it would i dont deserve the attention but thank you all anyway knowing that so many people actually care is astonishing to say the least thank you really,1
muted myself to cry while on the phone with my mom the idea of her daughter having depression is just unfathomable to her ironic because she works in a rehab center if i give even the smallest hint to my declining mental health she immediately starts to tell me stories of all these people she knows that have it worse i had to mute myself to cry because all it does is make me feel more bad i understand some live in tougher situations that i do but that doesnt motivate me to make a better life for myself if anything i feel like more of a failure and theres literally no point to anything fingers crossed i die in my sleep tonight 3,1
i feel like i have to at least try to kill myself before anyone takes me seriously 17f this is long and i feel like im attention seeking for even writing this but its how i feel i could never actually do anything but im tired and dont know what else to do everyone in my life seems to think that just because they dont see me crying 247 im not depressed but when i do end up opening up and crying they take it personally and blame themselves or me and make me feel so ungrateful that i feel horrible for even trying to express anything in result i usually try and suppress my emotions to keep from bothering anyone and especially prevent making my mom feel bad as she tries her best thankfully somedays im numb and cant feel anything at all my mom who i love dearly feels that because i dont pay any bills and dont go to work theres absolutely no reason why i should be depressed which makes sense i guess but my brain apparently doesnt agree lol i zone out as an escape sometimes and end up in deeper trouble im weeks behind on my schoolwork and have teachers calling me everyday being patronizing and snippy about the missing work and i hate myself for it im occupying valuable space in their class and for what i feel like ill never get caught up i just want to be dead or at least in the hospital or something so that theyll leave me alone a thought that ill most likely never act on every time i look at my work i get incredibly nervous and cant think of anything else but failing and how angry they probably are with me my mom is disappointed in me and no matter what i do or say she doesnt believe me and i end up giving up in the end because i feel like nothing i look like a terrible student which is so different from my previous school years i feel like i try so hard but theres no evidence to support it i really wish i could do more but i cant i try to force myself but i cant get much done and i dont know why im a terrible student dumb useless and cant complete work on time ive had no motivation for my work or anything else like washing my hair or getting out of bed completely disgusting i know i also have no friends normally people exaggerate and say they have no friends but at least have one or two i have none no one to talk to or confide in ive never fit in anywhere and have social anxiety no one cares no ones ever cared i struggle completely alone and have for seven years ive lost interest in everything i used to love and it hurts so much i think about killing myself almost everyday but im a coward and would never do it ive asked in the past about seeing a therapist covid makes the process even harder but felt so horrible even asking because my mom said fine but shed have to pick up extra shifts to afford it and that she didnt understand why i couldnt just talk to her because were close instead of being ungrateful and wanting to rely on a stranger and meds to make me stable like someone with real issues i know she was just frustrated but its statements like those that make me wish depression was more common and visible like the flu or something so that i wouldnt have to explain or feel weird or bad about getting treatment it wont be until i finally do something actually harmful physical and visible my current self harm which i dont do often isnt that i might get help if i can even be helped but i wont and probably never will i feel like nothing and a huge burden at the same time a complete failure and although i try to be as selfless as i can i appear and feel like a selfish ungrateful brat i dont have a bad life and my parents are great so why do i feel this way there have been days where it felt like it could possibly get better but i kid myself every time each year it somehow gets worst i dont really want to die but hate my entire existence and want to get away also i know this probably seems trivial and somewhat whiny im sorry for bothering you all i didnt know where else to put this and it felt somewhat soothing to vent thank you if you decided to read this edit im typically a very private person so it took a lot to share this thank you all for being kind and giving me advice im eternally grateful i feel less alone now it felt really nice to finally vent im staying strong and am not going to let depression win i thought about deleting this but if it helps someone ill leave it up,1

can you be severely depressed and high functioning i keep taking online quizzes for depression and i keep getting severely depressed but i think if im depressed im high functioning i dont think most people would think im struggling i seem like a happy person do well in school get stuff done but it is so hard to do every day i think the only thing that motivates me is my anxiety and guilt so it is not like i get things done because im feeling any optimism about life or a will to live edit reading everyones comments and want to say thank you so much it is really validating to hear from so many people who relate and i hope we all are able to find peace in life i wish i could respond to everyone but its hard when some of this stuff is so relatable or emotional to read just know i appreciate all of it,1
im 19 my girlfriend was murdered the trial is soon and im getting more and more depressive hi yall well im not used to posting on forums but i feel so bad atm and i cant open up about this to my family my friends or my therapist even if they want that i feel completely unable to talk about it with them im a 20yo man im irish but my family moved to france when i was 5 and that is where i have lived since i grew up in a small country village the school had only two classes i hardly spoke french but i got a friend very quickly ill call her honey in this post so honey and i were friends all our childhood we were in the same class every year and we were also neighbors so we played together every day after school year after year i became bilingual in french and made lots of friends but i started to have a crush on her when i was 11 we started middle school we were still in the same class and all our classmates were trying to get us together but we were pretty shy at that time so we didnt dare to flirt finally it was the following year when i was 12 years old that we got in relationship ofc the feelings i had for her werent as strong as those i had for her when we grew up up because we were still young but i was so happy she was the first girl i kissed the only one actually we kept growing up we were always in the same class every year and we kept spending all of our time together if i explain that its so that you understand that from my 5 to 19 years i almost spent every day of my life with her she gradually became as essential as breathing for me the more the years went by the more seriousimportant to each of us our relationship became we never argue ofc sometimes we didnt agree with each other but we knew how to put our differences aside and respect the point of view of the other then when i was 15 we started high school at that time we were in a relationship for almost three years and people were amazed by the longevity of our couple because at that age its unusual but we loved each other so much and i still love her so much it was like i had found the perfect person to me and i dont want to speak for her but i felt like i was perfect to her we kept growing up we did our first time together and all the others i never had sex with another girl we wrote long love letters to each other any pretext was good to say how much we loved each other i mean im kinda that clich of the chunk rugby player people dont really imagine me doing that yet for her id have done anything and everything she was so exceptional i felt incredibly privileged to be part of her life we graduated high school and that summer we moved into our apartment then started university i was so glad to live with her to sleep with her every night of course our parents let us sleep together on weekends and holidays but it wasnt the same it was a new step in our relationship and we were so happy when i explained to my new mates from the university that i had been with my girlfriend for 6 years they were stunned they asked me if i had never wanted to flirt with another girl or anything and the answer has always been no since my childhood i grew up alongside this exceptional girl and i always dreamed of being with her and i felt so lucky to be in a relationship with i never even noticed any other girl i found her perfect in every way we were so happy i just want to tell you a little bit about the great person she was she was so heart warmed she couldnt stand injustice she always wanted to help others she was so kind and caring whenever our friends needed advice or support for something she was the one they call she was full of wisdom and good intentions she was always smiling she illuminated peoples lives with her presence she was a very funny person as well she always saw the bright side of everything she was so positive she never gave up she worked hard to reach her goals she was so clever id even say brilliant she was a very gifted student she was passionate when she did something she put her whole heart into it she made people feeling special she knew how to bring out the best in them she always complimented everyone she was adorable she was also sensitive she hated seeing the ugly things of the world she could cry for that but she was also someone who made the world more beautiful by her mere presence ive never met someone so selfless and altruistic she was also incredibly beautiful the most beautiful woman ive ever seen she was an angel for her friends for her family for me for my family who loved her too my mam has three sons and she was used to say that honey was like her daughter my little brother was kinda an hooligan when he was younger and listened neither to my parents nor to me she spent so much time helping him because of her he really took control of his life again everyone loved her literally she was wonderful she was someone who loved to pamper people she could spend weeks making a gift or a surprise for someone but she was always embarrassed when someone gived a gift to her i think she was one of the few people who was sincere when they said they preferred to give than to receive i felt so good with her she was the love of my life literally i always wondered how she could love me so much i mean im not that bad and i always did my best especially for her but she was so much better than me and yet she still looked at me like i was one of the wonder of the world we were so happy i was only 19 years old and yet i saw my life with her and she saw her life with me we had lots of plans and even beyond me she was a great person who was so young and had her life ahead of her i mean if we had broken up itd have been incredibly hard but at least she would have kept existing living shining as she deserved but i cannot bear what happened we were together so happy and in love i never could have believed that she will disappear so quickly and in such a brutal way no one deserves that and when it happens to someone so close to you someone you love so much its extremely harsh it was a sunday and we were at our parents for the weekend sometimes on weekends we slept together and sometimes we slept on our own and we just spent the day together on saturday evening we slept each on our own her at her parents and me at mine there wasnt even a particular reason on sunday morning she wanted to run for an hour and offered me but i was lazy i was tired i wanted to stay in bed an hour more its absurd i was studying sports science and i was too lazy to go running id never forgive myself its an ongoing case so im not allowed to speak in detail about it and anyway it doesnt have to be but she was violently assaulted and tortured and died and then her body was burned suspects were arrested a few weeks later it was in feb 2019 and the trial was supposed to be in may 2020 but it was postponed because of the coronavirus france is in quarantine i cannot even describe the infinite pain i felt when a few days after his disappearance while very important research was being carried out her body was finally found and we knew what had happened to her i had a blackout since i woke up from this fading away i have been taking heavy psychotropes that doesnt prevent me from constantly having anxiety attacks and having to take a fuck ton of sleeping pills to sleep otherwise i have awful nightmares i never thought ill fall so low one day i have always been someone very happy and fullblown but i never thought that the love of my life was going to be murdered one day either i havent been going to university since i dont do anything except think about her all day i saw a lot of therapist but they only say shit how am i supposed to accept the sudden death of the person i love the most in the world and with whom i grew up believing that we were going to spend our lives together they tell me about the emotions of mourning but the only emotions i have are deep feelings of hopelessness and hatred towards those who did this i feel even worse since i know who did this and what their reasons were because they were people i knew i feel devastated sometimes i want to kill myself and sometimes i want to avenge her by killing them but i feel unable to inflict this pain on my parents who are very friends with honeys parents they had been friends for a long time before because we are neighbors and who help them a lot to hold on since it happened i can see that they have the fear is that i kill myself and to be in the same state as the parents of honey her parents are suffering so much they lost their only daughter and i dont know what to do to relieve their pain whenever i speak with them they seem so happy all of a sudden they say that honey kept living through me but imo its not true she no longer lives and will never lives again and i miss her so so much but i know if they say that its because they miss her so much too she is missed by everyone who knew her she was so wonderful and i will always miss her people tell me that one day when ill be happy again and ill meet someone else and go back to normal life but i know its wrong first ill never be happy again how am i supposed to live without her after growing up with her she was as essential to me as breathing its unbearable to survive since shes no longer there how can i resume a normal life and how can i meet someone else i never wanted when i was happy and she was there to meet someone else so it isnt now that im desperate without her that ill want to meet someone plus she is irreplaceable i feel devastated she is the only one i want and yet i know shell never come back i constantly think of her of her laughter her smile her scent i bought her perfume and i spray it on my pillow every day i know its stupid but its the only thing that helps me sleep a little better i just wanna hug her again sometimes when people lose a loved one they say they regret not telling them how much they mean to them and at least im relieved that honey knew how much i loved her and how important she was to me when she passed away because i told her every day just before the quarantine there was a commemoration for the one year of her death and everyone looked at me with pity as i no longer go to class in rugby or to see my friends i dont see anyone and i had not seen some people for several months they were dazed by my appearance and i hadnt realized but actually i became the shadow of myself i always was very strong and now im extremely bony it depressed me even more to see how many people seemed concerned when they saw me thats why i avoid my friends they dont know what to say and i understand thats normal in their place i wouldnt know what to say either and theyre also embarrassed not to know what to tell me the only person i used to open up to is honey and now having to deal with such difficult emotions without knowing to who open up is very painful my family is trying to support me as much as they can but its very hard there was a very bad atmosphere at home so much so that my parents broke up and my father went back to ireland with my older brother i feel like my mom and little brother dont know what to do with me anymore but i dont know what to do with me either i think that after the trial ill go to ireland for a while as well just to take a break here every time i go out everyone is aware of what happened throughout the region and even outside but here they recognize me so they look at me with that pitying air that depresses me even more im not afraid of the judgement i know theyll have a long sentence but im very afraid of the trial in itself and to during a week or two to hear what she has been through in detail all day to see her murderers and to hear what theyre going to say im anxious i cannot bear it for the moment im trying not to think about it i spend all my time in the tree hut that his father built between our gardens when we were younger we spent all our time there when we were teenagers and our parents didnt want us to sleep together we secretly met there and stayed all night everything remained as its when im there i feel calmer i feel like nothing can ever ease my pain i dont even know why i came to tell my story here i just needed to open up and i cant do it with my loved one i dont think anyone will have read this anyway,1
i feel disconnected i feel like ive just been observing my own life rather than living it if that makes sense i am stuck in a really stressful situation and i have no way of coping with it i have tried crying it out but i dont feel sad enough anymore the only emotions that ive been able to experience recently are anxiety and anger so much has happened in the past two years that i could literally witness a murder and i dont think it would have an effect on me everything seems to be losing its meaning to me even things that wouldve deeply upset me in the past or the things that i used to really enjoy and appreciate i hate whats happening to me its like theres a ball of dread and uneasiness building up inside and i cant really do anything to stop it,1
i called my dad on video and he started crying i havent seen him face to face in two years he told me youre so beautiful and successful im so proud of you he made me cry too i didnt have anyone else i can tell this to,0
i hate when people say life will get better i want life to be better not to get better i want it better now i dont want to wait for fate im done waiting besides the future is uncertain it could very well get better or it could get even worse and most of the times it may be out of your reach,1
hi need help xd what medicine do depresssd people usually overdose to kill themselves i have a person close to me that has been diagnosed with depression and i wanna protect them by hiding the medicine so they dont kill themselves,1
halloween all of my overdramatic emotions and expressions idiosyncrasies and distorted views of the world can be briefly manifested in the form of cartoon ghosts and skeletons bones orange and black costumes spider webs shitty cartoons and animated movies stores all decorated with the most corny decorations possible its the one season where i can accept my shadow for what it is and see it as just another cartoon ghoul rather than a death sentence,1
do i have depression im 13 and been having these problems for 35 yrs so i dont know if its just puberty or what but im always sad i can feel happy but not for long im always on the verge of tears and cry for no reason every time i look into the mirror i instinctively throw insults at myself if i dont have a distraction my mind thinks horriblenegative thoughts i lost my sense of empathy and now im just apathetic also i no longer care if i feel any physical pain even if it hurts a lot and then theres the thoughts about suicide they are more and more frequent the only thing stopping me from suicide is the fact that i dont to die a minor so is this depression or puberty,1
i need help i dont know what to do this is a throwaway account im utterly embarrassed with myself im young and have so much i feel like i can accomplish im sitting here at work writing this and currently having on of the worst days of my life i feel alone i feel unable to connect i am isolated i feel like nobody understands i dont blame anyone for not understand maybe im wrong i just want to feel better to feel connected i want to care about something other than myself i dont even know where to begin i am in a position where i believe there is so much negativity in my life it effects my internal optimism the real me is so much different than me i dont know how to explain that i dont know if others feel that way too theres the you who tries to be compassionate and caring but then deep down theres a different you i have such a hard time expressing myself because i feel like nobody cares how others feel you know why i feel like this i dont care how others feel well i kinda do let me put it like this lets say there is a guy i know called bob he tells me about his problems and how hard is life is i tell him that really sucks and i understand what im going through and suddenly he feels better now that hes had someone to vent to but the reason im trying to comfort him is not because i care about his issues i dont understand the pain he is going through the reason i comfort him is because i understand that connecting to someone in that way can be relieving it makes you feel like your not the only one going through that but what if thats just what everyone does thats how i feel about venting even though im sitting here typing to you you probably dont care and even though you may write something that is supposed to be comforting its not i dont believe you i cant honestly believe that the person youre talking to that you actually care for that person i dont know if thats true or not but my deep down me says it is true ive contemplated several reasonings to why i feel so i dont know how to describe it i dont trust anyone but myself i cannot express enough how hard it is for me to put these feelings into words when i was growing up i had terrible parents no they didnt hit me or physically abuse me they didnt play with my mind or do some of the terrible things you hear about so why do i say there were terrible parents they werent there they were but they werent all i ever remember is my mother coming home after we went to bed i remember my dad sitting in his room watching tv we never went out we never vacationed i dont feel like i know those people i feel isolated once i reached high school things changed a bit my parents split to no surprise from anyone my dad and i lived together and got somewhat closer i wanted to live with my mom but my sister did too and i didnt want my dad to have to live alone my dad was going through a deep depression at the time we would both stay home at night we didnt do anything i got the new cod black ops i start skipping school nothing feels good nothing feels right i just want to play video games its the only thing that takes me away its the only thing i look forward too i start skipping more i never make it to class after lunch anymore principal calls my dad to setup a meeting ive missed over 80 days of school im not going to be a freshman next year i used to be a straight a student in middle school i still think i could be i go through half of sophomore year with the same exact issues still skipping school i know its not the right thing to do but i hurt i dont care i want to escape we move across the country for a new start my dad and i move in with his mother my grandpa recently passed so she was quite lonely also my dad is a mamas boy for sure so this helped him out too i went to a new school had a new start i meet somebody the first of day she came up to me and started talking this is the first time anyone has ever reached out to me like that i feel different i feel confident maybe people do like me turns out we go to the same church were in the same ward the same classes she is amazing i meet another guy hes so cool hes extremely outgoing and we also go the same church the same school have some of the same classes both of them start dating i am absolutely crushed i feel alone i thought i found some people i could connect with but then puppy love takes over and once again im ignored i meet her best friend shes kind of cute and she really likes me ok what the hell lets give it a shot we start dating i think i like her lets makeout and hangout we should have sex sex is so cool oh you dont want to thats okay we can just start slow everytime she comes over its the same thing puppy love she starts to take notice that the relationship is very onesided im oblivious i want sex i want attention i want to feel normal but i cant take this stress she is causing me were over im done with you i dont feel bad about it then my two new friend that were together break up i dont want to step on my friends toes so i dont make any moves but shes amazing i actually care for her we start hanging out everday when they breakup i want to be with her i feel like at times she feels the same but at other times theres nothing she starts smoking cigarettes and this destroys me she is relieving stress and i dont care i just want to be there with her things escalate we get very close i feel like i can tell her anything things heat up sexually we constantly tease each other then she got a job and everything changed she met a guy we werent official or anything but i thought we were close i just dont know how to express how i feel to her and i feel like im a backup to her maybe i was maybe i wasnt she starts dating this new guy hes a bad influence he smokes and drinks and hes been to jail but the thing is care for her and i dont want to stand in the way of them being together so we revert back to friends theres no issue between us three they let me hang out with them whenever the guy likes me we smoke together one night they were at a park drinking they wanted to go home and he got in his truck he hit someone they were instantly killed hes running from police she gets out of the car he crashes into a park i cant believe it shes pregnant i cant deal with this a girl i work with tells me about a stoner friend she has she thinks we would like each other the three of us decided to hang out that night everything goes real smoothly i genuinely enjoy this girls company the three of us go to my house and watch some movies i get her friends number i invite her to hangout that night again she sneaks out and comes over to my house at late at night were hanging out and she makes a move things escalate and next thing i know my virginity is gone it is clear she had already lost hers our relationship quickly turns sexual she wants to fuck all the time im not looking for sexual relationship deep down but the cool me that i want everyone to know and like does want to fuck its cool its what happy people do this is a normal relationship we get walked in on doing oral by her moms boyfriend he hates me im a bad influence on her we keep seeing each other i start to really like the nonsexual part of our relationship her parents arent home and i go to see her she has to meet up with them in a few hours and they wont be coming home until after that meetup uh oh someone just came home quick hide next to my bed i have to leave right now dont worry whoever just came home is probably leaving soon too just leave after they leave so there i lay waiting for them to leave suddenly the door opens its the boyfriend he checks the room and finds me he doesnt let me leave he says im trespassing i tell him i was invited in and told to hide there he doesnt believe me he doesnt let me pass i try to push my way through and he threatens to call the cops this is bullshit i push through him and run downstairs to leave fuck her i cant believe she put me through that she shouldve taken the heat i start developing anxiety from that experience ive never had anxiety i didnt know anxiety existed until that point i never want to hear from her again but i really liked her i need to get out of here fuck this place fuck this town im tired of it i want to move back to where i came from at least i know area and hey weed is legal there so at least i got something that will help me so i tell everyone that im leaving nobody tries to stop me i have 300 in savings and plane ticket i have no where to stay i just know i want to leave im saving goodbye to some friends and my brother comes down were half brothers and his dad was black so he drives down to hang out with me i didnt know this at the time but hes running from the cops he was a warrant out in our home state he waits outside my house at the park next door till i wakeup to tell me that hes here someone calls the cop to complain someone is trying to take a bath in the community pool he was sitting a couple 100 feet away from the pool doing nothing the cops show up and he tells the officer that he is waiting for me i learn that someone called the cops on him for sitting in the park those fucking racist neighbors just because hes black doesnt mean hes homeless i talk to the cop but deny him being my brother at first because i didnt want to identify myself i was scared the cop harasses both us one of us is lying but we committed no real crime so he lets us go i say hey lets go smoke some weed with my friend so i drive his car over to my friends house and we light up then we decided to go to my other friends house so we leave my friends neighborhood were being followed but i didnt realize this at the time we get to a three way intersection i take a right and pull into the second lane because i have to take an immediate left after i pull over to next to the side walk and park i start unbuckling and next thing i know there is a cop next to my window he yells at me to roll down the window the window doesnt work i try to yell this through the door he tells me to open the door i comply i am literally shaking we have dabs in the car and a little bit of bud im scared he says he smells marijauna as soon as i open the door bullshit hes lying the bud is in a mason jar and the dabs have no smell unless your nose is right up to it he takes everyone out of his vehicle and starts by harassing me i know you have weed in there so just let me know where it is and this will all be over we dont mind calling the k9 unites to search your car and we probably wont stop them if they try to bite you in the ass i tell them where everything is i was scared they start harassing my brother we dont want your kind in this city leave and do not come back he is black is that the kind your talking about are you fucking kidding me right now do you fucking hear yourself were taken into custody and driven to the police station they take our pictures tell us how wrong we were no we werent doing anything wrong you guys profiled us and followed us out of one of the poorest neighborhoods in a very wealthy city you harassed us and assumed we had weed on us despite any evidence other than coming out of a poor neighborhood doesnt matter i have a plane ticket and im already leaving i arrive in this new city and hit up a craiglist contact i reached out to earlier were in similar positions hes a year older just moved to chicago hes very forward about the fact that he is homosexualwell call him bradley okay no problem i figure he realizes im not interested he offers me a place to stay with im for 300 perfect thats all i have i get a job at a local pizza place its perfect cause i can make tips to help me until next paycheck now i have no money turns out its not his house but were sharing his room in a house which other people from chicago the other people are great but they hate bradley bradley is a douche bradley suggest i might be a closet homosexual he will have sex with me if i want but he lets me know he would be the top he tells other people that im actually a 32 year old pretending to be 19 he tells other people im hiding my homosexuality he constantly describes homo sex to me i dont want to hear about it i tell him i dont care who he likes what gender he is i dont want to hear about his sex life he continues to harass me sexually i ask the other roommates if i can take the extra room upstairs ill pay for a fair share of the rent they all hate bradley and they agree its a shitty house and i want to move out i want to move closer to work i isolate myself further all these new people this is a new life im on my own now nobody is going to help me i find a roommate and we get a small apt to share i quit the pizza place after some bullshit that im over with bad management that blames the staff for everything just one example there was a busy wednesday night where i was the only server the ice cream machine breaks and im usually the one to fix it i dont have time as i am serving everyone im supposed to clean it every night we usually have two servers on a busy night like this i finally finish serving and cleaning up and at that point its midnight i have to back at 1pm the next day for lunch rush im exhausted from covering another servers shift i put a note on the ice cream machine not to turn it on as it is broken skip forward to 8 am when the owner blows up my phone because the ice cream machine wasnt cleaned properly last night and once he turned it on ice cream starting spilling everywhere are you fucking kidding me can you fucking read i come in to see the damage and i see the note still on the ice cream machine he says he saw the note but doesnt tell me anything more than that he didnt tell me why he decided to turn it on regardless of the note he yells at me for not staying later than i did even though i already worked an hour and a half past my get off time while working two fucking shifts long story short his wife told me she didnt have time to fix my paycheck with 10 overtime hours fucking missing off my paycheck fuck you bitch you dont deserve me as an employee and i walk out i then find the job opportunity of my life a web design firm is hiring okay awesome let me just apply and show them all my awesome skills i walk in to the interview everything is brand new everyone is dressed super nice everyone is super young i start and 3 days after being hired my supervisor is fired for nodding out i shouldve seen this sign and left right then and there the owner starts talking to me more and more he gives me special jobs and has talks with me all the time its clear he is doing some sort of drugs over the next few months and many raises later things start going really downhill this guy starts playing mind games with everyone someone is stealing is leads someone is always out to get him he wants to know who is stabbing him in the back he sets up elaborate traps to catch people in the act he ends up accusing me of stealing leads thats impossible i would never do that he sets it up so that i end up blaming another one of his top guys but if you look at all the evidence he planted he made it look like it was that guy who was stealing the leads so then he accuses me because of the accusations i made about his top guy this is some bullshit he calls me that night because he wants me to admit to it i go off him ive never felt so betrayed in my life i told him how bullshit it is that he is accusing me of lying to him he just lyed to me about all the evidence that made me accuse the other guy he says its gonna be ok and he forgives me he just wants me to tell him that it was me and it will all be over no fuck you it wasnt me go fuck yourself he contacts me the next day when i dont show up for work he says come hangout with me i just want to talk we go to the bank with another guy and spend a couple hours there opening up a new business account everything is going fine im explaining to him how betrayed i felt he apologizes and says it wont happen again then he decides he will take me home he pulls over the side of the road on the way home and crushes what appears to be 2 30mg percs and 2 lines of cocoa snorts that shit right up on the side of the fucking road i feel unsafe i want to leave this company never see this guy again and i do leave fuck this industry i want to make my own company and what do you know i isolate myself deeper i cant trust anybody they will just end up fucking you i get 3 other friends together as business partners the only way i can describe the next 6 months is us pretending to be a company its like when you were five and playing company with your little five year old friends we had meetings and sale pitches and presentations to potential clients but we never actually did any real nitty gritty work we played company for six months took in over 40k and spent all of it every customer charged back on us for not doing anything and that company went bankrupt very quickly at this point i had wasted a significant portion of savings trying to survive so now i was slightly in debt with no job only thing to do is to start my own company my own im the boss i take everything i learned from my previous experiences i rely on already established relationships for work i get enough freelance work to support myself and the company im working over 50 hours a week just to keep my company afloat its worth it to me i dont want anyone taking advantage of me im done with the bullshit im done with people fucking me im done so how does this all affect me now why do i feel more lost than i ever have been you know how someone is knowledgeable in a subject its when they realize that no matter how much they study and learn theyll never learn everything about the subject that realization in a person shows wisdom in that subject maybe thats how i feel about life at this point ill never truly get the point i want to be at and the reason i know that is from all the past experiences ive had im scared im anxious im stressed im alone i dont know how to connect with anyone i dont trust anyone im alone im isolated im scared and i dont know what to do nobody in my life at the moment is my age there is nobody i can come home to no friends or girlfriends nothing im alone i work more hours than i want to im dying i didnt take care of my teeth as an adolescent my teeth are practically falling out i have three molars that have practically decayed but i dont have enough money to do anything about it im still recovering from the debt i have accrued my car literally broke down two days ago after just fixing it i literally havent even paid off my last car billcost me 700 which put me into debt again now i need to pay around another 1000 just get it driveable again there is nobody to tell this too nobody is willing to help me im going to lose my clients not being able to transport myself to their places of business im fucked i got fucked im absolutely alone if you have read this far i want you to know im not asking for money here please dont offer im not here for monetary gain i dont know what im here for im sitting at my home office right now and my teeth hurt so fucking bad right now i wish i could just hug someone right now anybody i wish i could feel some level of comfort when all i want to do is to lay down and cry and as i write what i determine to be the last few thoughts of my ventilation tears are slowly rolling down my eyes i dont think i can press submit but it feels good to have these feelings come out of me i dont feel like there is anybody i could tell all of this too which is why im writing this right now i dont want anybody to try and help i dont know if i can press submit now it makes me feel like a burden i dont want to be a burden im just going to do it maybe somebody out there can shed some light for me,1
how to bury the hatchet im getting really stressed over certain stuff irl and the only outlet to ask about it or do anything really to socialize is reddit so im in a lot of things that i dont want to describe as precarious but are certainly really busy and kind of unpredictable and its all getting to be too much recently even though ironically i think i just got out of the storm and now am in a blind spot where things are healthier for just a minute i can relax but relaxing is making me stress out i tried laying in bed for a few days and just doing various hobbies and junk but its not working so i guess ill just keep posting to reddit and hope it works out posting to reddit is good anyway it gets people talking maybe who knows ill help someone else with my needing of help although i guess my original question here would be me wondering if sometimes its better to call something done and quits and pack up and leave but thats a bit of a rhetorical question as for me i know the answer is no but even if i wont be changing my mind i think hearing peoples advice would still be helpful just having other people to talk to is very nice or at the least listening to me ramble xd so thank you thats all,1
i would rather be sad than empty nothingness is so much worse than sadness when im sad i know how to help myself but theres nothing you can do against well nothing my body is a prison i cant escape no light no sounds no life just nothing im mentally dead there is no way out,1
how do i feel better ive been alone all my life the two relationships i did have were all based on me providing something the other needed first one i provided shelter second one i provided kids the drugs arent doing shit im not like crying all the time and shit but i have lost all faith and will to live the world is fucked im hanging by a thread and really have no idea where ill live if i dont make my loan payments and drive to mexico will they come after me to repo my car,1
i dont know what to say i just need to relive this pressure in my fucking head but theres no way of doing it no words no nothing i am trapped and i cant seem to convey to anyone how im being tortured daily by my brain i have bipolar 2 and adhd and im just done with dealing with them nothing has ever worked and ive pretty much lost all hope in treatments i just had to say something im in so much pain and im am a wreck im extremely unstable and the slightest things can make me crumble i am sick of this fucking shit this is no life,1
how do i target the physical symptoms of stress i know for a fact these are stress based problems ive had eczema hives acne ibs grey hair migraines and sleep disturbances due to my stress i feel like i shouldnt be having these reactions but i am i first tried symptomatic treatment of my eczema which worked until i got migraines then i got into an at fault car accident because of my migraines my ibs has been consistent but has been worse lately the front of my hair is turning grey and no amount of face routine helps my acne i get hives during exams and when im in generally stressful situations i just wish i could be someone who lives in a dorm without a job but with my parents money i wish i could put effort into my appearance or clothes or decorating my apartment instead im working full time and attending school full time im stressed and my health is suffering,1
probably i got myself to the point of burn out this has been going on for at least one month i have a really big trouble focusing on my homework i have to really push myself to get things done most of the times im too tired i feel like ive done a marathon or something like that and because of that i dont have any motivation to do something productive with my time this has also affected my sleep like ive started sleeping also in middays which is something i never did one thing that has been scaring me off is that ive started having ill try to censor it suicidal thoughts which is something i dont like having anyway thanks for reading and wow it feels so good to let these things out of myself lol,1
23 year old failure i still live with my parents i have been applying for electrical apprenticeships for a year now easily applied for over 500 and no one has offered me any chances people my age are buying apartments and in general just enjoying life i have no friendships i dont get people im a failure everyday i think about ending things because i dont think ill ever be able to make it,1
im drained from the constant changes in life last year i had a job in a profession that i really loved and i had a girlfriend who loved me im in my late 20s so i felt that maybe i can live a quiet stable life with a women i love i was completely over the 20something lifestyle of partying hookingup and just the aimlessness in general for the first time ever i was excited for the future fast forward to today and i had to quit the job because the specific workplace was toxic and the women i loved left me because her own mental health issues got the best of her i dont even know what else to write before the found the job and the girlfriend i was lost lonely and severely depressed the depression never fully went away but it began to feel like things were beginning to fall into place im just so goddamn sick of the constant chaos in this world why cant i live a peaceful life why does that seem to be a crime in this day and age,1
feeling i need to vent about life in general i just feel like i need to vent im 31 and currently living with my narc mom after covid hit i lost my job and out of desperation made the choice to move back i have both an autoimmune disorder lupus and currently dealing with major depression the combination of the two means that i deal with lots of fatigue and that a lot of times i dont really strongly feel like doing much of anything though i do force myself to get outside and im functional enough to i take care of the basic needs like daily hygiene and buying and making food for myself recently it has just been feeling very oppressive im in sort of a paradoxical position where i wish i wasnt all alone all the time i dont really have any local friends yet the depression keeps me from wanting to go and hang out with people i have anhedonia which means i dont really feel positive emotions such as joy and love but i am able to feel negative emotions such as frustration hurt and anger i struggle with self hate and when its at its worst i feel like i hate almost everyone ive been living in the same small town city now for about 15 years i know it wouldnt cure my depression but honestly a lot of times i wish i could just see different scenery im currently working on my masters in teaching when i first started out i felt on top of the world and then right after my first semester the major depression hit after a mental breakdown being on medication has helped and ive been able to get better since the initial breakdown but now im left worrying how am i going to have the motivation to make it through the rest of the program im tired and sometimes all i want to do is just sleep,1

i feel like i live for grades honestly i dont know when how and why it started but i have extreme fear i will fail my parents are cool about it nobody puts pressure in me but im the one who says that i cant fail in any way online school has really messed with me i started cheating on testssomething i would never do back in 2019 not because i didnt study but bcs i dont trust or believe in myself when i finish all exams i feel like there is no reason to exist so i start studying even if the tests are 2 months later ive been living this cicle for 16 years and im tired of living i constantly feel like dying is the only way i can rest it sounds childish i know but every time i have to do an exam i start being anxious about it and think i wont get a good grade so i end up getting desperate,1
feeling beaten today started so well and has ended so poorly my wife went to enrol on her college course today and did so only for a few hours later the college to basically pull the plug on this plan by denying us the funding for childcare that we need for her to be able to attend her course we are on benefits here in the uk as she raises our little boy whilst i go out and work full time as a teaching assistant so on low wages im enrolled on an open university masters that starts in october and she was going to go and do hairdressing at college this was supposed to be the start of us working our way out of the not so great financial situation we have in a few years i would have my masters and be able to pursue a career working with children like ive always wanted to that earns me far more money than i currently do my wife was going to be able to do her dream of being a ta for the part time hours most ta jobs offer and be a hairdresser on the side to earn a bit more money for us this was going to be the better life we had always wanted and always wanted for our two children and allow us to have a third if we wanted one but the college pulling the plug has just crushed us both her because it means she cant do the course she wants to do and better herself the way she wants to and me because it feels ive sunk into this rut of thinking that whenever we try to look forward and be optimistic and things seem to be going well for us it all comes crashing down around us and falls through i cant shake this feeling that no matter how positive and optimistic we can get its always going to fall apart i cant shake this feeling that no matter how hard we try were not going to be able to get out of a benefits system im beginning to feel like were trapped in this really sucks,1
im tired of being everyones therapist when no one will give me ten serious minutes of their time ive had a bunch of stuff happen to me in the past month i got appendicitis and surgery still recovering accidentally twisted my ankle i got a cold which im still fighting however none of that seemed to be enough for people to give me a break from emotional labor they demand it from me 247 practically not asking for advice really just ranting these are just a few examples i had my sister calling me talking about her boyfriend who just drinks all the time and does nothing and she was complaining about how she hates where she works i tell her to get rid of the man and get a job somewhere else it wasnt as short as it sounds i listened to her and gave her serious advice though i know she wont take it because she never does instead of thanking me no one ever does she tells me that its easy for me to tell her to just get another job because i dont have one and can just sit around and sleep well thanks i just love sitting around and thinking about my crappy life it is a positive joy we hadnt spoken until her son ended up in an issue and of course the family therapist me gets a text asking me to talk to her son and try to get him to listen to reason i agree just because i know my nephew doesnt get good support from her come to find out shes mad because hes dating some girl who has a kid already i cant say its great at his age but hes also an adult so i just told him to be careful watch out for emotional abuse and reminded him of his last relationship which was like a copy of his moms relationships she doesnt realize he gets his bad examples from her after talking to him his mom texts me and is like im getting off work in a few hours ill call and we can do a threeway call and talk to him nowhere did she ask me if this was okay didnt ask if i was busy or anything but as with most of my family since im at home i never have anything important to do so they just tell me to do stuff instead of asking like im a human being i tell her i texted him and i was still recovering and needed to sleep she didnt ask me what i was recovering from if i was okay nothing just said okay night my niece had trouble at school and shes a lot like my sister unable to let go of things shes upset because some girl at school wants to fight her because my niece took her chair a chair this girl wasnt using mind you but that was just sitting next to her my niece calls me upset and frantic over this because the girl wont let it go and went to the office and had my niece called out of class because the girl wanted an apology my niece refused because she said she hadnt even done anything and she went to the principal who told her that the girl is known for keeping things going so she wouldnt be bothered again but my niece wouldnt get off the phone until i promised to stay up until she got out of school in case they call her into the office again and she wanted me to talk to them a huge reason i dont have kids is so i dont have to deal with the stress of dealing with teachers and other parents yet i have to be a parent to my niece because my sister wont be mind you i had just come back from the doctor had been hopped up on pain meds and wanted to do nothing but sleep i forced myself to stay awake but thankfully no one called then my sister calls me and is crying telling me how much she wants her boyfriend to leave the house so i dont say anything and just let her talk finally shes like i just dont know what to do or how to get him out of my house i told her to call the police she doesnt want to get him in any more trouble because he has a dui because he drinks and drives she allows him to drink and drive her car because he doesnt have one and doesnt have a license i wont even touch how stupid that is so i get frustrated with her and tell her that i keep telling her how to get rid of him and she never listens so i dont know what she wants me to do she acts like i offended her and is like i just called to vent cant i vent sometimes i tell her that she can but im tired of getting calls almost every week about this man im not her therapist or life coach or anything im barely hanging on by a thread a lot of days and hearing about this situation distresses me because even if i dont like her very much i dont want to hear about anyone dealing with this type of stuff not to mention her best friend was killed just a few months ago by her boyfriend who was abusive and drunk a lot make him leave before he gets to that point anyway she accuses me of making it about me and hangs up maybe i did make it about me but i want people to understand that i am not a therapist and i cannot fix their issues and im not emotionally well enough to take on all this stuff im not sure anyone is tbh finally we come to today my mother had to take me to the doctor because i couldnt get there on my own and need support to get there were talking about normal stuff then shes like arent you tired of just sitting at home and doing nothing you really need to get out and get a life i dont ever like talking to my mom about my mental health because she acts like its a phase that should have been over in my teens and she doesnt understand why im letting it bother me as an adult id like to mention she has horrible anxiety as well but she powers through it to work at least it still takes over her life she also doesnt do much outside of the house and has no life but when i point that out she brings it back to me anyway i tell her i just paid all the bills and since the bills got higher i dont have money to have a life even if i wanted to so then shes like if you get a job youd have more money i know this but i have tried many times to hold a job i cannot do it for more than a few days without having panic attacks and breakdowns which either end up with me leaving or getting let go which then leads me into a deep depression she acts like i dont try and this is even with medicine and therapy sometimes im sure the main reason none of this works is because im around my family but i never tell them that because i dont want to deal with that fallout at this point im just tired of the conversation so i dont respond then she brings up how i need to get some friends at least says the woman who literally has one friend and who got upset at my aunt for going out without her even though she never goes anywhere when she invites her heavy eyeroll anyway i tell her that ive tried to have friends its not my fault they dont put effort in and either they end up not talking or i fade out because nothing is happening she asks me why i dont hang out with the people i met last summer the two girls i met last summer were nice but one would rarely go out with us because she would rather stay in with her boyfriend which left me and the other girl we hung out a few times but then she got a new trivia group and stopped texting me back so i stopped texting her and let that fade out this happens too often so i stopped trying to make friends i tell my mom that i dont talk to them anymore and shes like thats your problem you dont try and cut people off so quickly i texted the second girl every day for a week she wasnt working at the time and she was always posting snaps so i knew she was available i wasnt going to keep texting for no reason i try to have boundaries and get crapped on for them unfortunately i am not one of those people who will keep trying and trying and trying when i see things obviously arent going along anymore she then goes into this long story about how she met her only friend and how they only talk like once a month but they are still good friends and i need to be more realistic with friends what good is a friend whom i only talk to for 10 minutes once a month and hang out with maybe once every three months if that works for her great but thats not getting a life or anything else plus i have a history of getting friends and then i become the therapy friend and i fade away because all they ever do is come around to dump their problems on me and get advice then i dont hear from them for months when something else is going wrong thats not friendship to me and go back to my mom and my aunt my aunt is mad at my mom for checking up on her at her age and of course i get pulled into it because my mom is being childish and wont talk to my aunt so ive been designated the gobetween but i never said i would be they are 20 years older than me why am i even in this i dont know im just tired of being everyones therapist and mediator i keep trying to explain how draining it is they obviously see i have my own issues but they continually pour their issues onto me expect sincere helpful empathetic responses but let me feel bad or need something and everyone is busy or doesnt answer their phones or i get advice that isnt helpful my niece and nephew would probably talk but i dont want to burden them with my issues their mother does that to them enough and they complain about it to me of course what is it about me that makes everyone think im a therapist plus none of them pay me for my services that probably makes me more upset than anything if i was a real therapist id probably be rich off all these sessions lol,1

when does ideation become a risk for an attempt ive always had suicidal ideation and it fluctuates occasionally between a reassuring last resort and a constant overwhelming obsession im currently looking for a psychiatrist but in the meantime im often concerned that i might be slowly drifting towards an actual attempt i know its impossible to give me advice comparable to someone actually sitting down and working with me but i would like to hear from people who have attempted suicide or people who have worked with those who have ideation or tendencies how or when did you know you or your patient was officially an immediate risk to themselves thank you for any words and advice,1

experiencing depression after high school so i started college a week ago and virtually every single day has gotten worse and worse nothing bad at all about the college itself but my head is all fucked up to start my story i was a pretty big deal in high school homecoming king sports class president the whole nine yards thought i had something to prove so i went away 4 hours to college while all my friends went to cc in my hometown after graduation i fell into a slump for about a week but was still playing baseball hanging out with my friends so i got out of it and was doing good not anymore every day i go to class eat and play xbox by myself until night every single night i lay up and think about how good life was for 4 years and then start to realize that life is in the past and gone forever i start thinking about what i would do with another go at hs all the things i miss and if i shouldve stayed home where i was comfortable i havent really had issues with thinking about self harm its just like theres a constant cloud over my head and no matter what i do the reality of my situation always makes things worse hoping someone in this sub has been through this and has some advice hoping this makes sense,1
how do i recover my creativity after stress dont know if this is the right place for this but ive searched other subs and this seems like the best place to me ive been through a lot of stress and maybe some undiagnosed depression in the last two years between the death of a close loved one job and financial stress severe relationship problems health issues and a bad living situation i existed just to go to work where my coworkers helped me destress and laugh but slept until i had to leave and came home just to get in bed again im a creative person with a lot of drive to make things and this used to give me a lot of purpose in my life but during this time id stopped doing almost anything but watching comedy specials on tv i was finally on the upswing of all that and feeling more like myself and finally got back into my writing which is my passion but my stress threshold is still fucked up so when in march i felt forced to quit my sewing job over a heated argumentfight with my boss it broke me again not as bad as last year but i lost the routine id just settled into and most of the writing drive i had ive lost i worked there for six years and had a strong role and responsibilities that i had integrated as part of my identity that job felt like who i am i had a comfortable lax second job already thats now my main income and im fine there and once again starting to come back out of that darkness im able to do some crafting in bed but still spend most of my time with the tv on im also getting a gentle morning routine going and that helps but the big problem is my creative drive i want to create things im investing money in a voice recording set up and i want to narrate and write and read im wasting time cross stitching for hours every night while i binge shows i dont really care about when i have perfect chunks of time to do the things i crave getting back into the motivation isnt there how do i do it how do i get back into things i love when ive finally reached the other side of the stress and how do get myself strong again after so much so that the next thing to come along doesnt break me all over again,1
i thought going back to work would make me motivated and my depression get bettermade it worse now i feel trapped back to being a nurse again after taking a 1 year from having my daughter always been a workaholic since i was 18 years oldso thought if i immerse myself back into workall my problems will be fixed i can shine at work and be proud of myself now all i feel is like im making mistakes at workbrain fog and the weight of depression on me is greater than it was the plan did not work and i want out what the hell love helping others and being caring and i feel nothing got home and just drank wine no food i dont deserve to eat i feel like a failure to all of those around me my mental health is declining and i dont know how much i can continue,1

today i had my first session with my psychologist it was tense i talked him through some dark stuff he showed empathy like no other and i immediately felt like i already knew him and vice versa at the end of the session he asked for my id for administrative purposes when he saw my date of birth and realized it was my birthday he cracked up and through his chuckles he demanded who the hell sets up an appointment on his birthday of course i couldnt care less if it was my birthday i tend to forget my own age however his laugh was so genuine and from such a good heart that at last i recognized the ridiculousness and joined his laughter it was the first time i felt 100 comfortable with another person in the same room i couldnt have asked for a better present edit i cant thank you all enough for the wishes and positivity ive been an active rdepression dweller for the past few months and ive never been let down recovery or not this community will always have a special place in my heart the bond that links your true family is not one of blood but of respect and joy in each others life i know its far fetched but it applies for me today,0

falling back into severe depression with responsibilities hello friends throwaway for reasons i really needed a place to let this out besides therapy ill try to keep specifics to a minimum as my social circle browses the subreddit occasionally and isnt something im currently sharing with all of them a short backstory ever since high school ive suffered from various severities of depression this peaked in 20182019 when i attempted to take my own life on two occasions and luckily failed both times without serious repercussions health wise fast forward a year or two i have a child with a woman who i am no longer with and fatherhood has been absolutely amazing i know its cliche but it really is life changing i wouldnt give it up for anything while things have been mostly civil with coparenting as you can imagine issues arise more often than with a couple who is together ive really tried to let things roll off and keep things as positive as i can for the kiddos sake but the last couple months those old feelings have started to sneak back in especially when there is some kind of conflict with the mother i find myself in a very guilt ridden situation i feel awful whenever the thoughts of taking my life creep back in especially when i am a father now i always push them down out of pure guilt for thinking them because i love my child and cannot imagine life awaywithout them in a lot of ways its worse than before because i always told myself i had a way out and i feel like i do not have that option anymore rightly has anyone else dealt with this i know im not alone in the world and my feelings are not entirely unique i just needed to get it out somewhere it helps thanks for listening,1
stress is affecting my sleep i have been waking up at 2 30 in the morning in the last two weeks if i am lucky ive slept 4 hours then i am up and down for the rest of the night apparently i am having night terrors where i am fighting and yelling in the hours that i do sleep i didnt know that that generally only happens when i am very stressed out does anyone have any hints on what i can do before going to sleep that will relax me enough to sleep through the night,1
im a 13 year old boy who is abused and need help im 13 years old and i live with my dad im shared custody from my mom to my dad my dad is very abusive towards me ive been diagnosed with depression and ptsd and ive gone to the hospital twice over suicide attempts because every time im with my dad i want to kill myself he pushes me to the limit and im afraid that ever since i was little my dad has always beaten me with a belt even before i was old enough for school my dad has beaten me for not doing what i was told to do he yells curse words at me and uses my mother as an example of what not to be and that makes me feel sad because i miss my mom recently my grades dropped ive been having problems at school i have a hard time focusing and paying attention to what im being taught my dad was pissed one moment hes screaming at me and cursing me out and telling me i wont achieve anything in life and telling me im going to regret it when hes done with me my 11 year old brother also made a bad grade so he walked into my brothers room and i heard screaming and loud sound from my dad hitting him with a belt then he walked up to me and told me to give him my hand i held my hand out and he hit me extremely hard with the belt i screamed and held my hand but he told me to hold my hand out again he continue to do it over and over again then he told both of us to come in the kitchen he started yelling at us saying he was in an ass whooping mood and that hed beat us whenever we felt like it that if we didnt care about our grades he wouldnt care either that hed make us feel his pain he hit me extremely hard my hand was red and swollen i had a bruise on my wrist that was slightly swollen and stung to the touch he told me to hurry and wash the dishes before hed do it again and he did but my hand hurt too badly he threatened to hold me down im going to kill myself if i have to continue to live with him i cannot take this anymore and no one will do anything about it i decided that when i go back to my moms on sunday i am refusing to go back to my dads this is what its come to because he refuses to cooperate and my mom doesnt have enough money to get a lawyer and free legal aid takes too long so i am not going i know my dad will call the police if i dont go when they come i will talk to them and tell them my situation can they force me to go what will they do because in order to get me to go they would have to physically drag me i am in fear of my life and i dont want to die but he just pushes me to that limit so i just cant be around him i dont know how many times ive tried to tell my dad this and even my therapists have tried to tell him this he doesnt care he simply denies treating me the way he does saying hes never called me the things he does on a daily basis like dumbass idiot son of a b and he even calls my brother those things and denies it then when were in public or around other people he acts like a totally sweet person and his girlfriend thinks that im the problem because he constantly complains about me when really its just a big show what will the cops do about it when they come,1
i feel like suicide is inevitable not that i want to kill myself right this instant but it feels like its too late to prevent it something bad is going to happen later on down the line and then ill just end it theres no way around it so long as i dont die suddenly in a car crash or something i feel like im one of those people who just never gets better edit why did this post blow up this was just a depressive vent post edit 2 why is this being given wholesome awards reddit baffles me sometimes edit 3 i feel like i should add some context to my depression that may differ from your own experience my depression mainly comes from a place of selfloathing and my own inability to accept myself i have people who i care about and who care about me but i feel like depression has manifested into my personality and it is a part of who i am now this is why i feel that suicide is inevitable for me personally,1

how can i tackle my stress im someone who stresses about everything controllable or not controllable i can get lost in my thoughts about things so far in the future that i shouldnt be worrying about my face has broken out some and i think its directly related does anyone have good verbal antidotes to tell myself to stop stressing or any other good remedies,1
i feel like im watching my life crash and i cant stop it this all started in october i lost my mom on the 11th that alone is still hard to deal with she was my rock my person to run to when i was stressed or couldnt figure how to handle certain things as a parent or as an adult there were understandably missed days of work which caused lost wages only two days were covered for me and my husband was out of vacation days none were covered for him this caused us to fall back on a few bills we live on a tight budget as it is there was no insurance for mom so no way to financially put back our wages it started a slow spiral littered with late fees and then came early december where we had a choice of keeping our place to live or keeping our car we lost our car luckily my dad was able to step in and was helping us get to and from work until we could get a car but three days ago they put his dad on the morphine drip he is watching his dad die in the same slow manner he watched my mom the hospice nurses oddly the same ones who saw my mom out have turned his oxygen up to 5 and understandably my dad doesnt want to leave his side so here we are im about to call my job for the second day and beg for a ride or not to get fired my husbands parents are sort of helping him but still leaving it up in the air everyday before he is supposed to be at work but i work the overnight no one is willing to help me get there and home we have called taxi services around us it would cost over 100 for him to get to work and back and close to 50 for me this is crazy and im so nervous everything at once im worried about losing my job then losing the roof we fought so hard to keep over our kids head we gave up our car to keep no matter how hard we work no matter that both of us have rarely missed days and worked for the same companies for years both very good workers but one horrible moment in my life has us standing on the edge of losing everything we make too much to ask the state for help but not enough to miss a few days to grieve the loss of the best person in our family without ruining our lives im just on the edge and i have no idea what im supposed to do anymore and the one person who would know who could help isnt around to help us thanks for listening well reading i guess,1
my 2 best friends together while im in the other class 1 week ago our school sent an email to us telling us in wich classroom we would be ive learned that my 2 best friends were in 216 class while i would be in 217 i dont have a purpose for school anymore and its destroying me being aways from them is really hard to deal with and i dont know what to do,1
im worried im going to disappoint my family i dont really know where to turn and im running out of options im in med school abroad and am embroiled in trying to earn a few more points on a major exam so that i can attend my sisters wedding which is to be held in the states the exam i failed has a make up but it is literally scheduled the day after the wedding so to travel back abroad still means i would have to miss out on the occasion which itself cant be delayed any further i know that i am not the strongest of students but i really felt confident with the particular exam and now because of my own damn fault i may be withheld from going i just feel like im letting everyone down like im just destined to keep failing its hard to talk to people close to me on this matter despite me doing so because it just goes back into this loop of you did this to yourself you need to dedicate more time to studying etc i dont disagree with the feedback but its not helping me right now i just feel trapped update well i tried i went to the university office and it was such a farce they stopped any conversation saying their hands are tied or we are legally bound from doing including providing the answer key to said exam so that i could see where the points were lost i wont be attending my sisters wedding and will have to sit in for the make up exam i never minded sitting for the exam its just the timing of it all i could go on about how pathetic the scheduling system is how i cant even access the exam admit card until a few days prior to the exam but its not going to do me any good wish me luck on this exam please youve all been very kind as for my family of course they are understanding of the situation i just feel horrible letting them down,1
this year how many of yall have had an exceptionally crappy year just a series of unfortunate events nonstop ive always had anxiety issues and will literally not sleep or eat until a problem is at least subdued if not resolved yet ive also been very very adept at avoiding nonsense and misery in general all up until this year it started with covid making life a bit difficult we a share that issue though a bit later in the year a very close family member attempts suicide and that alone brought so many issues that lasted a few months after that episode my 8 year old cat my best little dude passed away due to severe anemia and i spent 3k of my savings trying to save him now i have what potentially could be a blood disorder if not possible maybe future leukemia family members have had that shit ive slept maybe 10 hours in the last 3 days and for the first time in years im terrified and also for the first time in a long time i broke down in tears for a few hours earlier wishing my cat was here i miss the fuck out of him i live by the moto it could always be worse but now this time it seems it probably will get worse this year seems to get weirder and weirder i had so many plans set for this year i wanted to get a house take my cat out for car rides more get a better job get a home gym run more fix my truck up go out with friends and maybe find a woman to share my time with all of that snuffed out and it took my cat with it im in my late 20s and i bust my ass of for my health and wellness and now even that is under heavy threat im definitely not the only one with these issues i probably have it great to some of you it sure does seem odd that this all happens this year though as if darkness is catching up how are yall doing,1

depression can cause weight gain or weight loss but saying youve not been eating is seen as much more socially acceptable than saying youve been eating too much even though the cause is pretty much the same ive both gained and lost weight due to depression but i feel people see weight gain as much more embarrassing or just overall negative than if you lose weight as a result of depression the cause is the same but everyone sees weight gain as disgusting it hurts,1

broke up with my m23 ex f23 exactly a year ago and i still cant seem to cope with the reality and move forwards so im not sure if my story would fit the motif of this sub but i cant seem to find any other places that would help me otherwise hopefully this would be the place my ex and i broke up at the end of august exactly one year ago after being in a relationship for two years we shared the same friend group studied in the same department had affections for each other and what meant to happen happened now i was not a great partner by any mean even though she was everything to me and i blame myself every single day for letting it happen i completely understood her decision for dumping my ass it just hurt so much that even after one year i still cant move forwards the whole shenanigan happened during my senior year and it certainly affected my dissertation work very badly for a few months afterwards i managed to push myself and come to school regularly to work on my thesis i worked in a lab for my thesis statement there were many other issues parts of it due to the fact that i was not into the academic by any means and i had skipped a whole year previously to work part time jobs just because i disliked the subject so much this gap year specifically and the differences in academic motivation were big reasons why she dumped me the other was seeing her and her new partner she found someone else immediately afterwards in the same faculty that we were in on a daily basis and it just hurt my weak ass so much that i would not be able to concentrate at all for the rest of the day so in order to distract myself from the facts mostly i found myself using tinder its kind of a meme where im from hopefully to find a friend a partner of some sorts this was going on for a few months having met a couple of really nice girls before i realized i was no good to them and what i was doing is selfish and unhealthy so better off just to keep the affliction to myself and not put it on other people now moving forwards because of that realization in addition with my suffering in school i decided to quit school entirely hopefully to come back someday quit my part time job not like i was able to work properly anyway and found myself stuck inside for the past 7 months or so i also stopped chatting and seeing my friends all together i share a small friend group of 10 11 people in college with my ex and thats about it i studied high school abroad so no bff around im a dumbbell at keeping contacts as well she is a regular chatter and i cant put myself in any further emotional pain especially when she suddenly decides to talk about her now partner in our group now im not an outgoing individual and ever since my failure at studying abroad i love medicine and was hoping to continue studying abroad after high school but failed to do so due to financial issues so im back in my country doing the complete opposite of what i like i started to develop a mild condition of depression it came to my exs recognition too but she wanted nothing to deal with it it finally crossed the line after the break up in addition to all the stress i got from school and family i sought a diagnosis earlier this year and was on medication for a few months though having known the conditions of mental health support in my country and the financial situation my family is in i relied on the medication alone and it has not helped just one bit i realize this has been quite a rant and some of you may call me weak which i agree a hundred and ten percents btw i just helplessly felt the need to let this pain off my chest and hopefully get some advices in return but otherwise i truly appreciate your reading and maybe somehow i can manage to get myself together in the near future if not then it was nice knowing you all tldr high school goals shattered due to financial problem back to nam disliked college and the chosen academic found a girl broke up due to differences in academic motivation fell into depression and have been selflocked inside ever since found ways to distract myself but to no avail cut off all contacts and medication is not helping help,1

am i a bad friendperson first sorry for my english some grammar might be wanky secondly i recently stuggle a lot because i live alone for the first time in my life in a new town where i know no one and lastly are my thoughts and feelings all over the place because i think i might have undiagnosed adhd and anxiety or maybe i am just weird i dont know i recently got in contact with a very good friend of mine with whom i didnt talk with for over a year lets call him ben he wasis one of my best friends i introduced him to my female best friend lets call her alex the first person in my life that understands me so well and shares so many interest with me we all share a common intrest in video games pc and play together often almost daily they both recently broke up with their so and i immediately felt that ben had a thing for alex but i didnt think much of it at the time once i confessed to him that i had a crush on him a long time ago and that i wouldnt be aversed if he would feel the same someday knowing fully well that i was in the never ending friendzone but i was glad that i told him anyway alex also was part of that conversation but i dont think she really cared because they started dating 2 weeks later without me knowing while playing with them and talking with them on discord i felt the tension between them tbh at that time i thought they might make a really cute couple they were sweet to each other and they had so much in commonbut i was more afraid of what would happen once they started going outwould there still be space for me what happens if they break up will i lose ben again i asked ben if he had feelings for her because it was kinda obvious but he didnt want to admit it at first because of my confession a few weeks back but i assured him that even if i had a crush on him right now my feelings wouldnt matter if they loved each otheror so i thought a day later my mood dropped i cried and talked to alex about itthat i even wished that the two of them never met because i feel like losing them and especially her she was really considered and assured me that she would always be there for me and that i am the first friend she ever felt so connected with i was happy but felt bad for having such thoughts i wanted them to disappear but they didnt not then not now a week later i realised that talking to her made me feel better and less anxious but a day later they announced to me that they were dating i told them in all honesty that i was happy for them they are so similar and cute together it had to happen but i also told them i was jealouswhy i dont know if it is because i myself am single of if i really havehad a crush on ben or that i knew i would spend less time with alex from know on i tried to hide my bad feelings and started to mask them always staying happy and understanding i think rather successfully but the last three days were toughthey started to hang out without me more often something completely normal and things that couples should do as much as they wantis what i am saying and should be feeling honestlybut i feel alonei dont have many friends i struggle with asking others to hang out ben and alex are the ones i spent 90 of my time with and its hard for me to see them be happy without me all my thoughts are all over the place i wish for them to be happy i love them both so muchbut on the other hand i wish they never met or leave me behind they dont realise that i struggelbut thats because i dont want to tell them i shouldnt be their stepping stone i shouldnt be like broken glass laying around themmy feelings shouldnt matter when they want to be alone or if they ignore me because they are freshly in love and only have eyes for each otheri understand i was there toobut it hurts i cry for the third day not knowing what to do i dont want to burden them i dont want to hurt them but i feel lost lonely and worthless am i a bad person am i a shitty friend i dont wanna be the special snowflake that needs special care because she cant keep her feelings in placemy depression keeps getting the better of me and my anxiety takes overi feel like disappearing foreverbut for what reason this is no reason to make me feel like dying its a stupid reason and i want to cast these feelings aside but it seems impossiblehelp,1

desk job stress i must have messed up bc my boss had a meeting closed door where they were shreiking about me why does she always say yes to everything if they cant do it listen i get that people dont want to talk directly to me just about me it must be because i have selective mutism and present as really mentally slow it really stresses me when that happens why do i say yes to everything i attribute it to a real fear of saying no to authority figures possibly rooted in abuse not sure so my brain is telling me i need to work harder so they dont yell and such or be upset with me how do i do this there are only 24 hrs in a day do i pull an all nighter what if something comes up during the day where i need energy im fucked but i cant be shit at this job,1
anhedonia is the worst part of depression youre alive but you arent living you feel like doing something anything but nothing is appealing everything feels like a chore and its exhausting do things that you enjoy doing doesnt work since everything feels like watching paint dry realising that youre slowly beginning to lose interest in the few things you enjoy doing and realising that theres nothing you can do about it is mentally torturing its like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands its hopeless the only thing you look forwards to is death,1

hello again im deep back into depression im falling forward off the mountain and blind from dense painful fog fog that makes me close my eyes so the only pain i feel is the jagged rocks on my body almost hoping that one of the rocks welts my own eyelids shut so i dont even get the curiosity to look i know i should look so that i can shield myself from upcoming blows but i just want to keep my eyes closed and curl up and let fate decide my conclusion i want to die before i reach the bottom of the mountain and not even because of the pain or fear of death i want to die now because whether or not i survive has no bearing on the fact that in the end ill be at the bottom of a mountain with nobody around me and nowhere to go,1

an anonymous stranger paid for my breakfast today today is my birthday its been a hard couple of weeks and so today i decided to treat myself to breakfast before i headed to work i decided to wear a silly birthday girl pin to make myself feel a little more festive when the server came around after i finished my meal she took my plate and said your meals been covered happy birthday ive never had something like this happened to me before i felt like i could cry right then and there it could have been anyone who walked by me that paid for it but i have a feeling it may have been that server whoever it was thank you no matter if its a hard work day today i know that there are people out there who care thank you,0
i am so mad at myself and people around me i hate myself for being useless and i hated even more when people asking why i am doing what i am doing cant you see i am trying to understand the situation i dont know if you are really asking the reason or you are just being sarcastic because i am just keep trying to compromise your idea and never use mine and every day i told myself it is fine since my idea is probably not very useful compare to others but i think i am just going crazy right now because i could not understand a word you are saying and i cannot catch up and you are questioning my choices for catching up i really hope you will feel this one day when you get to another new project where you are working with complete strangers stop acting you are the leader if you just going to move forward with people you like,1

handling my family im a fifteen yr old male and my older brother 20yr was recently diagnosed with autism he is high functioning but has a lot of social issues ive had to rearrange my entire life to cater to his needs now and its difficult and for some reason whenever we argue like all siblings do or i argue with my mom they always make me out to be the villain in every situation heres an example weve recently decided to rewatch the entire mci timeline of movies because we enjoy them almost every five minutes my brother will point out very minuscule details at first i had no problem with it but when we got to the iron man movies it went from five minutes to every ten seconds constantly ohhh thats that iron man suit number or is it the other oneohhhh let me check and is constantly talking all the other small details that dont really matter at the moment cause were just trying to watch a movie and hes just rambling so i pause the movie and ask him to stop he says and ok and then just keeps going this happens around to more times before i snap telling him to just be quiet and watch the movie and then my mother stepped in heres context earlier when we were watching a different mcu movie my mother was very confused about the plotstory so i said hey mom can you put down your phone for this scene it explains everything she nods and watches the rest of the movie joyfully and laughing now lets get back to when she stepped in between me and my brother later she agrees that he needs to settle down but then im immediately bombarded with her trying to make me the villain and then asks whats so important that youre looking at youre phone during the movie in a sarcastic and i replied just looking at my phone why are you mad at me about it you did it earlier and then she snapped now defending my brother in previous arguments she tends to be very minuscule with details and i always have a retort because most of the time shes just angry and doesnt know what shes talking about and then flips the fact that i rebutted into me being the bad guy in every situation it gets worse because shes a hypocrite about it when i get annoyed and snappy and go down to the same amount of detail that she uses when she argues she gets mad at me except when shes the one doing the nit picking and using the small details in her mind it is somehow justified and i shouldnt be annoyed at her it seems like a mental trap that im always the villain in these situations any advice on how to handle this stress i need it edit now that i have left the room because my mother didnt feel like continuing the movie because i somehow ruined it she said she was going to sleep that was a lie because she is now joyfully chatting with my brother i almost feel like my family is happier without me maybe im the problem,1

my life in a nutshell having anxiety and depression is like being scared and tired at the same time its the fear of failure but no urge or will to be productive its wanting friends but hate socializing its wanting to be alone but not wanting to be lonely its caring about everything just to abruptly care about nothing its the feeling of feeling everything at once then feeling paralysingly numb its wanting to get help but subconsciously knowing it wont make a difference because you cant see the light at the end of the tunnel you are just tired of being in the tunnel,1
i really wish i could kill myself before the new year so i dont have to deal with whatever misery 2020 is going to bring there have been like at least three suicides on the tracks this month and i so very much want to be one of thembut as much as i want to commit suicide i dont want to commit murder and it would kill my mom if i did it so here i am facing another lonely worthless year im so tired of this im just so so tired i dont know why im posting like i said im not going to do it i wont do that to my mombut i really wish this could be over,1

my aunt and uncle said they would take me in and let me live with them this is honestly the best news ive received in such a long time like im legit crying right now and can barely type i posted a few hours ago about my dad passing away a year ago and how my life has felt so empty and cold without him it still does to this day i miss just being in his arms and miss every little thing about him you have no idea and when he passed my aunt and uncle were actually taking some time apart from each other because of marital issues they still came to the funeral and even stayed with me in my apartment for a week after theyve always been loving and affectionate and all that even though they were on the other side of the country at the time they did offer me the chance to come live with them but i declined because i still had to finish college he never got to the chance to see me in my cap and gown anyway after i made my posts i quickly called my aunt first and asked her if i could come stay with them eventually my uncle came in and we talked for about a half hour until my uncle asked in a genuinely curious tone why do you want to come now though and i just told them the truth im scared i dont like being alone like this and not even having a friend nearby for support its just me but thankfully they reassured me and said theyd love for me to come even offering to pay for a plane ticket i cried myself hysterical after they hung up and its also extremely timely since my lease on my apartment is up in the end of july and i havent renewed yet im just a mix of genuinely happy but also still sad that hes gone im not even sure what to do with his ashes since he didnt specify where i should take them or anything like that but im at least more hopeful,0

how long does it last it frightens me to know that depression can follow you into the future it frightens me to know that this feeling can make you feel the ugliest of things that you wouldnt wish on anyone elseit frightens me to have these involuntary thoughts invade and take hold of me for unknown lengths of times gripping around me like a corset it worsens when there are triggers its worsened over time and whenever i feel like im getting better it just comes back and washes all of my productivity my discipline my determination my happiness all away im tired of having to mask for periods of time during social interactions during work during a small moment like going to the kitchen and having to say hello to someone thats in there im becoming increasingly exhausted i have those thoughts that we never want to have im constantly wanting to just erase the pain i constantly feel like a bother to people who ask if im alright i swear im not seeking attention i swear im not lazy i just wanna be happy i dont even know why im here if im just meant to experience this horrible vicious cycle,1

does anyone else get sad when they hear about sex or relationships idk for me being in a relationship was and is a goal for me and having not been in one yet it kinda stings because its like an attack on my two biggest insecurities my looks and my personality like whenever i see a reference to sex it just makes me sad because it feels like its rubbing it in and reminding me i wont have that and like im 18 so its an age where a lot of ppl are getting into relationships so it def hurts to see everyone around me in one all the power to them but when i see it i just feel depressed,1
me vs also me me omg look all that hard work has gained an extraordinary achievement and i reached a gamelife changing goal it is amazing i love itomg yayayaya also me thinkingface this much awesomeness has absolutely got to be too good to be true i must panic and stress over it until i find why it is not amazing result alter mindset get out of panic mode be realistic it is good in the here and now it may not always be amazing but for now it is you have the tools and courage to make a change if it ever begins to steal away from your life know that and enjoy the here and now with balance,0
have you guys ever felt like doing something but depression just makes you stay in bed like if i wanna play some video game my brain will be like nah go to sleep and it really pisses me off because i feel like im letting the days pass and with this corona virus out there if i die i wouldve enjoyed the thing that i most love in this world which is gaming,1
i really hate when people invalidate a depression diagnosis as someone being lazy and etc depression doesnt exist you just want to be special and quirky you stay in bed all day cause youre lazy most people diagnosed with depression dont even meet the diagnostic criteria why cant you just be happy depression is just an excuse i think ive heard it all at this point really if depression doesnt exist is that why i lay in bed all day starving myself if depression doesnt exist is that why i leave the duty that is showering at weeks at a time i didnt realize being smelly was special and quirky if depression doesnt exist is that why i wont leave my house do you honestly think laziness is the reason i was reported as a missing person to the police if depression doesnt exist why do i cry when i glance at myself in the mirror why am i isolating myself from family and friends why did i cut into my wrists why did i abuse substances if depression didnt exist an open letter to all those people out there saying just be happy thats cute youve probably had a comfortable life with parents who loved you unlike me whose relationship with my parents has always been toxic my dad first invalidated my diagnosis at 16 by saying depression didnt exist he also threatened to kick me out onto the streets and then again 2 years after that when my anorexia got worse he just keeps me around cause i have some leftover money from school and he wants it ive come close to suicide a few times once when i was 16 and another time when i was 20 recently its been on mind as im hitting new lows but i dont think i could ever do it cause im just so in love with my boyfriend though if he ever betrayed me who knows what id do i dont know myself it feels like i have no one except him and i know what men are like after being cheated on before in past relationships,1
hi ive recently gone into a depression this is my first post here and could do with some help so basically a week or so ago my friend came up to me and admitted he was bi at the time i was in a very happy relationship with a girl then later that night i started questioning myself and whether i was straight and found myself falling out of love with her over the next few days so i called it off and now i have no attraction to women and im questioning whether i like guys now i keep looking at every guy and wondering if im into them i just feel so overwhelmed because ive only ever been attracted fo girls and ive never had a time where i wasnt attracted to a girl but now theres just nothing and to question my sexuality which ive never done before is so confusing and scary because ive never been attracted to guys before but now im just thinking maybe because id never thought about it that i actually do like men im just so unmotivated and upset every day now does anyone no what to do sorry if this was long i just really want to stop feeling this way and go back to being happy with my girlfriend now i just dont feel like living as much and i dont want to be bi,1
stress experienced at baggage claim so after finding out that a lot of travelers found baggage claim to be extremely stressful i began looking for a solution i came across a device that notifies you when your suitcase is on the conveyer belt and makes baggage claim stressfree and more productive instead of standing around stressing about the whereabouts of your bags and monitoring the crowded conveyer belt you could plan your trip answer an email finish some work read watch a tv show ect in peace knowing exactly when you can pick up your suitcase does this solve that problem and is it interesting view poll,1
i survived my suicide attempt yesterday i had lost all hope and just went ahead and hung myself from the ceiling fan made sure to lock everything so i cant be saved as soon as i moved the chair under my feet i thought my neck would break cuz it was considerably high but it didnt happen had a really bad choking experience and let me tell you it hurts really bad half a min in i went unconscious due to the severe pain woke up to me lying on the ground my mum and dad crying and me choking on some blood i dont remember how long i did stay that way but apparently not long enough had a long talk with my parents and its better now im not sure whats gonna happen next edit im 17years old,1

meeting a fellow suicidal student in middle school changed my outlook on life you really never know whats going on with someone this is a reminder to just be kind when you can because you dont know whats happening under the surface i was reading a post that reminded me of a certain conversation i had with a fellow student back in 7th grade i was in a lab group with three other kids and this guy who was insanely smart and always cracking jokes rolls up his sleeves hes got all these scars on them and so another girl in the group asks about them he just casually tells us he has a cutting problem his parents had to confiscate knives and things the rest of the group kind of just was like ok wow thats scary and then we just did the assignment i feel like i missed an opportunity there to help someone out this guy just opened up about something so personal and i sort of just was shocked and confused so i didnt comfort him and i didnt say anything touching or kind back honestly i think i just couldnt process it was he joking for me at least lots of people joked about depression and suicide all the time in middle school it had never occurred to me that some of these people actually felt that way when i think back on the whole interaction i realize i would never have known the internal struggle this guy had even existed if i didnt just happen to be in his lab group and he just happened to roll up his sleeves im also really bothered by the fact that no one was concerned in the group including myself another thing that severely bothers me is the fact that this was middle school i feel like thats so crazy young and the reality that kids were already facing so much pressure and stress forces me to seriously question what the heck is going on in society right now the main thing that this has taught me is that you seriously never know what someone is going through i would never have guessed that this kid hated themselves like that he was so smart i kind of was jealous at times and he made the wittiest jokes 247 and he was always smiling i dont know what has happened to him i think he switched schools the next year or moved or something wherever he is i hope hes doing well and i hope hes found some real support since our school didnt provide it,1
life story alert ive never really considered myself suicidal but i have had thoughts before i have undiagnosed ocd and invasive thoughts so ive always assumed the suicidal thoughts were invasive in which they probably are because i have no compulsions or motivation to follow through i guess i mainly find comfort in the fact it is an option in a way it makes me feel like i am in control im 28 with absolutely no friends i am married with 2 kids and they are the reason i am alive today i am still lonely as hell i always thought i was going to have the typical boys like in sitcoms poker night football watch parties always popping up unannounced etc all my friends are either dead in prison or addicted to drugs reason for the is because i have abandoned anyone that puts me or my family at risk kind of makes me feel guilty but my kids and wife come first i struggle to find my purpose im obese and that paired with my mental health issues makes it hard for me to work a normal job i run a small demolition company to make ends meet it puts me in control of my situation and my schedule the downfall is it has made me more anti social then ever i have a problem meetingtrusting new people because to be honest most of my past friends and people that ive met have been total losers i didnt have the greatest childhood it wasnt terrible either though my mom has always been a lost soul in a way blamed my dad for making her move to wisconsin from california was always going to the barbringing home random dudes so my sister pretty much raised me moved in with my dad when i was 12 he worked 12 hour days 6 days a week so never really spent time with him beyond weekend movie nights always kind of felt like a burden and treated like a chore instead of truly being pushed to become my best self worst part is i find myself treating my daughter like a burden because of my mental health makes me easily annoyed and very impatient i wish i had some damn patience anyway so after i moved in with my dad i started falling into the wrong crowd and eventually got sent back to my moms when i was 15 well long story in the middle of a long story short she called a social worker and sent me to a group home was i being a shit stain yea i was selling weed but who just abandons their child over that anyway after going through the group homes my dad took me back after 3 months back with my dad i met my wife at 17 everything was good for 3 years besides the fact my wifes parents dispised me and did everything in their power to tear us a part hindsight 2020 i cant blame them because i was encouraging her to sneak outstay the night with me against their rules then at 20 i had my daughter its one of the best days of my life i love my daughter to death but ever since then ive had added pressure and this sense of being restricted that i never felt before added note i was homeless from 13 to 23 besides the short stints i lived with my mom dad or was in the group home from 2023 i just couldnt get my shit together job after job followed by irresponsible choice after irresponsible choice finally at 23 after couch hopping all those years me and my wife got our first placethat we kept more then 3 months life started turning around and then i had my first panic attack talk about getting torn a new asshole as i do with everything though i pushed through and weathered the storm fast forward 3 years and i welcomed my son into the world another best moment ever followed by added pressure and more restriction this was shortly after i started my business and stuff started picking up for the first time in my life i started having hope actual fucking hope this continued for a year and a half at this time the rental we were at had a pipe burst and basically ruined the ceiling my landlord being the pos he is took months to fix it and when he did we had to be out of the house for a week this was our breaking point when it came to him and the rental market in the area we decided to relocate 3 hours away that was 6 months ago this is when everything seemed to fall apart ive always been the person that finds the best in everything and maintains a positive mindset even when the house is burning down that flew out the fucking window about 5 months ago ive gained more weight my business isnt surviving the move unemployed no friends i feel trapped and the pressure puts an instapot to shame i have eleminated every responsibility possible because im scared i will fail it is hard for me to get out of bed because i feel like my life has no purpose i truly dont think i would ever kill myself like i stated im fairly certain its just my invasive thoughts acting up im strongly against medications it is not that i think they dont work i am honestly scared of the side affects and feel like i am mentally strong enough to deal with the problems without them also i dont trust therapy because i dont believe there are enough subcategories for mental illness i dont want to get be misunderstood or diagnosed with something i dont have due to someone who basis their expertise on knowledge obtained 1520 years ago feel like technology has had a detrimental affect on mental health i dont know what i am wanting out of this post support criticism advice i am not really sure maybe i am hoping someone might read this and find strength knowing its ok to not be ok sometimes maybe im reaching out hoping someone might have gone through this and can help me regardless i dont plan on going anywhere i know that no matter how hard shit gets no matter how much you think people dont care about you killing yourself will destroy peoples lives that you care about suffer for them so they dont suffer because of you thank you love you,1
i dont wanna kill myself i just dont wanna wake up anymore idk if that makes sense but i dont want to kill myself i really dont i want to be killed i want to be shot or to not wake up i dont want to make the choice to kill myself because my friends and family will feel responsible but i want to die,1
forcing myself to do things makes me hate them doing nothing makes me hate myself the first advice you see on googling depression is do things you used to enjoy right well ive gotten really good at making myself do things i make myself do my job i make myself do a side hustle i make myself read books and post about them on my blog this month im making myself do nanowrimo i presume the idea is that at some point you start enjoying things again but i havent ever managed to get to that stage i dread my side hustle i never know what to say about books until i start writing i write exactly the number of words i need to hit my goal and then i stop i dont enjoy any of it some of it i really hate and ive been doing the side hustle for a year and five months and the blog for two years so its not a matter of it give it time i dont know how to make myself do things if i dont treat them as obligations anything optional i just dont do it feels like a vicious cycle where the only way to make myself do something also makes me hate it is there a way around this has anyone else felt this i cant seem to find anything online that even mentions this being a problem let alone actually proposing a solution im trying to make myself go for a walk every day because thats supposed to be good for your mood and it feels like an actual punishment,1
my mother told me something imma prolly never forget right so my mum is africannigerian and im saying this because when it comes to career choices and education theyparents are serious about it she told me my entire life to choose science so i decided to go for physics im am 15 an already have chosen my options so it might be a bit too late since i chose my options at school but recently she said it doesnt matter what you do kelechi i want you to do welll and be succesful she didnt know then but honestly it made me genuinely happy because she knew that i liked music and i wanted to do it as a sidejob apart from an actual job like a macdonalds worker or a career like a physicst i love her so much man,0
i said hi to my ex at school but it felt really good i took my exam early and i was about to dip i left my classroom and she was walking into the opposite classroom across me i didnt really get to check her out i think its a good thing i just got locked into her new haircut i didnt say anything until she opened the door but i was hoping she didnt hear me maybe my mask muffled it hey cool hair facewithtearsofjoy facewithtearsofjoy facewithtearsofjoy facewithtearsofjoy she turned around and i gave her a thumbs up manfacepalming in all honesty it made me happy i was able to say that she looked great and i couldnt help but think her haircut signified a new beginning been smiling since i left school i washed my car seat cover but theres a strand of your hair stuck on it not sure how it makes me wonder things too many to be honest but i cant help but be happy for you life is going to be so great to you and i hope you embrace it like you always do i hope i can too soon i really do,0

i used to feel all types of negative emotions rarely experiencing the positive ones prana and chi enthusiasts have you ever looked deeper into the act of smiling and honestly i dont understand why no one talks about this i think that the evil agents of this world are trying to suppress this knowledge from the public the feelgood neurotransmitters dopamineendorphinsandserotoninare all released when a smile flashes across your face we all know that right but you would be surprised after realizing that its one of the many expressions of the water type prana this very specific water type prana is also the main force behind manipulating your auric field which you can notice that its hidden under your goosebumps you mightve heard of the many names of prana before chi lifeforce prana qi piti rapture chills spiritual chillls goosebumps ecstasy euphoria aura mana and many more if you are interested in this i made this short tutorial youtube video explaining how you can flood yourself with positive hormones by recognizing the force of this prana that is used when we smile,1
does anyone else stay up super late to avoid the next day i dont know if that makes sense what i mean is that i stay up as late as possible wasting time because i know that if i go to sleep ill wake up and have to go to school i usually go to bed at around 3 30am and get up at 6am and its destroying me ive been doing this for months and im physically weak and exhausted constantly because of it but my depression and anxiety demand it and they always seem to get their way edit im really glad that this spoke to so many people it feels good knowing im not alone sending lots of love to you all this isnt easy but i believe in you redheart,1

stress vent low key plea for help and advice i have no job at the moment over the summer i started a landscaping company with my partner and things were starting off top notch when the summer ended i was starting school after dropping out after 2 years i dropped out because i had a huge falling out with an extremely close friend of mine i dont want to put too much details on what that falling out was but basically i destroyed his trust in me and not only that i lost literally every friend i had me and him where so close together that when shit hit the fan the other people in our circle stopped talking to me it took me 2 years to recoup my social loss and all the depression i had i had tried to commit suicide but failed after saying goodbye to my friends over the phone they called the police and they came out to speak with me during this time i also started to delete all my social media i deleted my twitter account instagram and partially my facebook i took down all my photos of my face and unfriended all my close friends except family because my only means of communication are thru facebook finally during that summer i started feeling like myself again as if things could turn for the better instead of the worse i chose to go back to school to try and put myself back on a good track in life when i was in school before the events above i was planning on joining the us army as a second lieutenant its been a dream and passion of mine since i was born my parents have pictures of me all over the house in army costumes and huge cardboard boxes that i drew on to look like tanks i felt alive being in that uniform especially in college as i joined the universitys rotc program unfortunately as i grew older my parents health became poorer and poorer my father has crushed discs in his spine as well as diabetes and early onset dementia its mostly he will forget directions to the store and what he did yesterday or 3 hours ago but apparently he will soon forget our names my mom has ms and fibromyalgia on top of ptsd from some trauma she experienced thru her childhood as well as had extensive surgeries in the past both take extremely potent pain killers my dad is the worst with it he literally snorts them like coke and does atleast 57 a day my mom has to control how much he takes but there pain is so severe most days theres no other remedy i can really show them i tried talking them into medical weed but my parents arent interested in the properties and say they wont work from there medical history you can tell they dont have any income except for my oldest brother who is a high functioning autistic adult currently on his masters program at the same school i was attending so financial issues has always been a problem for our family we dont have any other family with us both my moms side and my dads side hate us for some reason so its really just me that they depend on i have another older brother but he moved out and hasnt spoken to any of us in awhile he calls during the holidays but thats really the only contact we have my parents are alwaysalways behind the ball on bills and we have had multiple disconnections from the electric company one time they didnt pay for 3 months straight and the bill totaled 866 on top of reconnection fees so i had to figure out how to pay all of it because my parents had no earthly idea how to come up with the money every month for the past 3 years has been a challenge for money ive worked jobs stolen things sold drugs just to keep us up but its just never enough 2 years ago they had a house they where buying and had went behind on the mortgage for almost 6 months i had no idea because they never told me about it they lost the house and had to move into a rental and who took care of that i did ive been having to care for my sick parents since i graduated high school i had to put my dreams aside because i couldnt just leave for the military they couldnt even last the couple of months i would be gone for training so i put my dreams away to try and hustle and work to bring them out i started looking into ways of making as much money as i possibly can but everytime i make a breakthrough something happens like my car breaking down or something doesnt get covered by insurance and since i stole it had come back to haunt me which of course i expected thankfully i never had to go to court or anything so im having to pay a restitution which is too much a month for me to pay and yes i have been missing those payments i understand the repercussions of those actions but i have to focus my energy on maintaining my apartment which i rent ontop of my parents house which i help pay a portion for as well as the electric and internet as well as dog food for the dogs the gas for me and my dads car a portion of my oldest brothers books as well as other things here and there to keep them afloat and alive i am drowning in debt i went back to school to try and get a business degree this semester but the age old need for assistance from me came back to haunt me and instead of investing my financial aid from college on some business ideas i had to try and make it ended up going to there bills and mine when i realized i spent all my grant and scholarship money on bills and not my textbooks and school stuff i just withdrew no point in going to class unprepared also since its the fall we have had no business for landscaping so weve been short on jobs ive been trying to apply for seasonal work and other jobs but so far its been more of a bust than anything good now im 1 week late on rent for my apartment i have to come up with close to 1000 in less than 3 days to pay my rent my bills and my parents rent and bills so im basically beyond fucked i could kill myself but its not gonna solve the problem i just dont know what to do and tbh i just wish i can be someone else right now like delete this saved game and start new lol thats my rant for the day i dont expect anyone to respond to this so if you read this and commented thanks for listening,1

i started a new job today and i can honestly say things are looking up i started a new job today im in michigan and the place im working is a marijuana cultivation facility the pay is good the benefits are good and i get paid to play with bud all day moreso i am so proud of myself for starting to get help and work through my issues i started some meds to help with my depression and because of that things have been getting so much better i am actively trying to do better with my life be healthier eat healthier getting a new job is one of those things that made me open my eyes i was working in a dead end place before you cant go anywhere with mcdonalds you can move up into a management position but thats more than likely the only place you will go at my new job its such a growing industry heh heh that the opportunities to grow as a person are tremendous and i cant wait to learn everything there is to know anyway i dont have many people i can tell so i thought i would tell you guys thank you for letting me share my excitement for once in my life i am actually able to say i am a happy person its been so long for me to get to that point and im incredibly grateful for where i am now there is still so much hard work to do on my end but things are getting better,1

chronic stressanxiety and the aftermath of its related issues so long story short on the outside i have the seemingly perfect life 31yo female with no remarkable health issues a thriving career making a decent living a happy and healthy young daughter in a long term relationship with a man who loves me my daughters father a beautiful home nice car no real financial troubles aside from overspendingundersaving however i have been dealing with major chronic stressanxiety for about a year now stemming mostly from my relationship 75 stepchildren related and now my job because i am unable to resolve this stress i have always had anxiety issues so i have been an evening marijuana user for approx 8 years to wind down and help me sleep this stress has recently turned into depression 9 months ago when my stepdaughter was alienated from us because of me it was then i started to notice new troubling acute and intermittent symptoms like brain fog poor concentration no libido inability to relay thoughts consistently and effectively extreme fatigue no appetite no strength high bpracing heart weakness to name a few 4 days ago i experienced what i believed to be a mini stroke although i was alert i felt very disoriented couldnt talk normally felt confused off balance numbness in hands felt like i was gliding rather than walking after a couple of hours i eventually went to urgent care to get my symptoms reviewed as i simply just did not want to commit myself to ed if it was not 100 necessary i know that wasnt the best option in that moment however i felt for me it was neuro exam review was fine they said and she said i likely had an inner ear infection and gave me antivert and said to follow up with pcp me knowing my history i was not sold on that diagnosis but felt fine enough to accept it today i followed up with my pcp whom ive been with for 10 years she agreed that it likely wasnt an inner ear infection due to lack of symptoms so i have an mri ordered and will be going tomorrow i actually work in the medical field specifically mental health and addiction so i am very well aware that my stressanxietydepressionmj use are likely the reason for my issues i am concerned about the damage my body has endured with this strokelike incident has this stress simply turned my otherwise healthy body over for good i know without a doubt all of these issues have put me where i am today a few weeks ago prior to the stroke incident i was certain i had ms due to all my progressive symptoms yet knowing deep down the real most likely culprits that would need to cease before going to major diagnosis like that but the only missing symptom was a stroke then bam that happens i have not used mj for 4 days im fine without it but the relationship and kid stress is something that will not stop or go away basically ive decided to finally move out to get away from the stress i cannot control and im hoping that will save my life work related stress i used to handle like a champ but now im falling behind at work and unable to catch up if things keep going this way i will eventually lose my job or worse my life as this constant fight or flight is slowly killing me my mood is just emotionless at this point im simply in survival mode which has essentially ruinedended my relationship i realize i must make some major lifestyle changes i am just hoping to hear that these issues are resolvable assuming i make the right decisions i also am well aware that chronic mj use plays the biggest part in my mental health conditions however i had used that to cope with them up until now when i physically just cannot do that anymore anyone have anything to say not even sure what im looking for here other than someone who has experienced this and understands what im going through,1

lifes just bland just ventingignore i came to this reddit to post about whats been on my mind but looking at other peoples posts it really puts into perspective how dumb my issues are when people are going through actual life changing shit somehow it makes me feel worse since i still feel like shit and i know i shouldnt and i should just deal with it my issue is that i just feel like i dont have any real friends and whats worse is that i know its my own fault and mine alone i have probably 1015 friends at school and i know they all snap eachother and have their groupchats and hang out with eachother but when i was younger i was really busy with soccer and i never really got in to that now it just feels like its too late for me i feel like no one would even talk to me unless i talked to them first no one would notice i was missing for a day or a week at school and they certainly wouldnt care i feel like my only value to them is that im good in schoolhave answers and hw etc and im good at soccer when school soccer comes around i used to have a best friend who i hung out with often im really not sure what happened but we arent best friends anymore i do not think even the small things make me feel left out driving to events together sitting in cars hanging out before school and then stuff like hanging out just makes me feel unwanted no one ever invites me asks me where i am what im up to im just an afterthought maybe ill get remember maybe not doesnt matter to them apparently and its only made worse because i agree with them and i understand i dont bring anything to the friend group im not real funny or nice or anything out of the norm that isnt school or soccer ive been telling myself for a while i just have to get to collegecurrently a junior in hs and ill have a chance to start again be more social talk to more people but i realize now that is a lie its not just a switch i can flip i cant just choose to be how all of my friends are i just never learned howmy own fault im not depressed i dont think thats reserved for people with actual problems not stupid friend quarrels but life doesnt feel very good either i dont look forward to school anymore i dont want to see my friends only to feel even more left out when they talk abt their plans together later that day as i stand next to them im only happy when im playing video games or on the soccer field in between that lifes just cold grey and mediocre if thats life then im truly not sure that i want it why should i keep living with so little to look forward to especially when i cant even man up and be more social on my own i sat in a parking lot today thinking abt why i would want to live and i couldnt think of much that was for myself i guess ill just keep living cuz im too scared to really do it and for my family my life is just a melancholy thing my one childhood is blown ill never have what they had and thats just an incredibly depressing idea for me also fuck you,1

life doesnt get better unless you take actions to make it better but depression itself can make it impossible to act exercisephysical activity eating healthy spending time in nature finding a hobby are all things that are supposed to be good for your mental health but by definition depression is a problem precisely because it inhibits your inability to function much less do things that are good for you finding a therapist trialling multiple therapists to see which one suits me best or even starting on antidepressants and having to check in with a doctorpsychiatrist every few weeks or having to change medications because one might fuck up my head even more or not even work all takes so much fucking effort that i cant bother to do any of it i went to a counsellor at my university earlier this year and they suggested things like group therapy for my anxiety and volunteering for causes because that can give people a sense of purpose in day to day life and i just didnt know how to tell them that is exactly the problem i have utterly no will to do any of that and thats why im sitting in your office right now and i dont know what anyone can possibly do about me being this way if people with depression were able to so easily do things to help themselves we wouldnt need to classify it as an illness or disorder thats why its so infuriating when we see how even professional mental health advocacy organizations repeat the hackneyed slogans which i cannot understand how they are even still in mass circulation its so irrational and frustrating that im physically able to take ten steps out of the house to just go on a goddamn walk but i have absolutely no mental will to do anything but lie in bed only listening to music is the only action that can be done purely passively with no effort whatsoever but then i just get sad and start spiralling from guilt and i cant stop thinking about how irrational it is even though ive experienced it for so many years im constantly surprising myself from my own incompetence as if i ever expected anything different more than hopelessness i just feel confused as to what im supposed to do when i cant will myself to do anything what even is this anymore edit thank you for all the comments i didnt expect to get any response its hard to describe but i feel very moved that there are people out there that i reached in a small way for a short moment of time,1

venting i am super stressed atm bc my bfs family doesnt want to get vaccinated and since he lives w them i cant see him normally his mom is in my opinion super controlling and wont let him get vaccinated they are also not properly isolating and dont seem to take covid that seriously it causes me so much stress and anxiety and makes me so frustrated i have never felt this hopeless and angry in my life to top it all off they literally dont understand vaccines at all and are constantly making bogus claims which i find even more difficult to listen to seeing as my degree is focused on biology and healthcare i understand that its out of my control but the knowledge that it is affecting others not only them stresses me out to no end,1
im just saying ive never been thankful that i didnt kill myself ever since my first suicidal thoughts when i was like 14 22 now people say arent you so thankful youre still here no the answer is always no ive never once thought im glad i didnt do it ive only ever regretted not doing it if i had just acted on my first suicidal impulses or any of them after id have been so much better off not a thing has happened i shouldve cared about missing my life has only gotten so so much worse now i wish i felt how i did when i first felt suicidal that was roses compared to this shit and i actively wanted to die then too my life has gotten so much more fucked up than i couldve ever thought then and i really only wouldve missed out on suffering ive only been alive because 1 suicide is way harder than people think and 2 im supposed to and guess what im not thankful for it jesus christ do i wish i had just killed myself 8 years ago or any time since ive never once been thankful for not killing myself,1
whats the point in asking for help if no one actually cares i did everything right today i gathered my thoughts i talked to my best friend and then i finally went to my husband and told him everything the suicidal thoughts that have gotten worse over the past two weeks that i think im experiencing delusions and paranoia that im genuinely scared for my safety and all i really got was a well get through this and that was it i mentioned possibly needing to go to the er or look for an inpatient facility to get help because of how rapidly this was progressing and he told me but what if it financially ruins us what then and i just stopped its cheaper to bury me than it is to give a single fuck about me and help me get treatment i did everything right i fucking begged for help but its not that serious until you actually kill yourself and by then its too fucking late i have a therapist and psychiatrist ive tried 20 plus meds with absolutely no benefit ive been dismissed by every psych ive had because to them its just depression and they wont listen regarding the delusions im having that are completely fucking up my life,1
i feel so grateful to have found such a loving supportive life partner my boyfriend and i have been together for nearly 7 years so far and weve built such a strong bond im forever grateful to have someone so loving in my life ive watched him become a fully licensed electrician to a firefighter to now obtaining his masters electrical license and more hes watched and helped me graduate college navigate through covid to find a job and more weve supported each others fitness goals and never gave up together we recently bought our first home and now are slowly building the next chapter our of lives im so excited,0

i cant keep doing this 16 f ive never knew how stressed out i was with everything two days ago i had a mental breakdown at work i remember hanging clothes on the sales floor and having suicidal thoughts i remember not being able to breathe so i quickly ran to the restroom and broke down in tears i started banging on the sink out of frustration and anger i havent been diagnosed yet but if the doctor told me i had depression anxiety and bipolar depression i dont think i would be surprised my manager came in the restroom and asked me what was wrong but i couldnt get it out this is my a millionth time crying at work just last week i congratulated myself for not calling out sick when i was really just depressed i told her she should leave and not to worry about whats wrong with me because im use to constantly crying i then leave the restroom and ran to my car without clocking out my crying became even louder and i started banging on the steering wheel while screaming i just dont know what to do anymore ever since that day ive been thinking about going to do things such as getting my nose pierced but lord knows how my african parents would take thatat a point when i dont even care anymore and do what makes me happy they already werent happy when i first got my hair locked up when i came home later that day my mom asked me why was i crying at work of course i couldnt tell her because african parents never take this type of shit serious so i shrugged it off my school called my mom back in january about my suicide attempt and she was pissed off about it she told me not to tell them that next time its been so many fucked up shit to happen to me within just one time frame this year but i mean everyone had a bad year this year,1
becoming a regular at a local coffee shop changed my life i was depressed failing school etc and i decided i should do my homework at a coffee shop one day i went in and the owner was super nice and asked me if i wanted to join the rewards program and i was really craving community at this point and i was super excited i kept coming back to the shop to do my homework and the owner and the baristas would always welcome me and they were always happy to see me i started to get to know everybody there very well and now i consider them all friends i found that when depressed having different communities helps a lot and it turns out a lot of the other regulars at coffee shops also are depressed or have other mental illnesses a two dollar drink can let you stay there for a few hours and by being nice to everyone around you and being somewhat productive on work it can be a really great place to have,1

i have lost my empathy before my depression there was warmth and curiosity in my personality when people i cared about told me their stories i listened and felt happy for them when i saw a family member struggling i would feel compassion for them and i would do what i could to help them i seem to have lost this when someone tells me about themselves or their experiences i dont care unless it affects me their stories are boring to listen to even the closest life events engagements marriages accidents ilness none of it interests me i feel extremely guilty over this and its a big part of my illness when i speak to someone i feel intense anxiety and a bit of fear it feels like the person speaking to me will get upset because im not enthustiastic or engaged in the conversation as if theyll think i dont enjoy spending time with them and thus stop spending time with me im afraid of losing them and being alone its true though i dont enjoy spending time with them which is part of why i feel so horrible in the first place i know that the problem is me not them my friends and family are fantastic people and weve been very close in the past but when i think about my memories with them i feel nothing i have avoided them for about 5 years because of this ill come to family gatherings when its unavoidable like christmas but every time im asked to come visit someone or someone asks me if they can visit i make up excuses,1

my ongoing journey with stress and how to cope i find stress to be like most things in life good in moderation i have found myself in many stressful situations at work that have forced me to focus on whats important and to get it done with too little stress i find i have no motivation to move forward too much stress or the wrong kind of stress can be debilitating and possibly detrimental to your health there have been many times where i have stressed myself out over what ifs that i end up saying fuck it or i end up in a ball on the floor sick to my stomach whether its going out by myself to see a friends band talking to a girl or reaching out to others when i need help and my mom has stressed herself out to the point where shes had panic attacks in the past it wasnt until the past few months that ive come to understand stress or at least come to an understanding that helps me for me stress boils down to a conflict between the way things are and the way i want them to be for example right now i am trying to launch a side business maintain my 95 help my wife with our 9 month old son and train for several up coming endurance events i want things to go smoothly and find time for everything but life has other plans a couple of months ago my team was working on a big release for our product and i had a pivotal role there were some nights where there was never a break i would put in a quick workout after work cook dinner for my family try to make some progress with my side business and after my son went to bed i had to do some work for my 95 i felt overwhelmed i felt guilty that i wasnt doing more and most of all i felt like i wasnt good enough i wasnt a good enough employee i wasnt a good enough entrepreneur i wasnt a good enough husband and i wasnt a good enough father there was one night where i skipped dinner and just cried in bedi had two options 1 let the stress get the better of me and drop some of the things i am trying to do or 2 figure out a way to cope for me the first step in coping was mindful meditation where i learned that i am not my thought and i am not my emotions i learned to quiet my mind and focus i learned how to separate myself from emotions im not saying that emotions are bad i still feel everything but i dont allow them to control me or send me into a tail spin anymore my second step was realizing that the mental physical and emotional selves are interconnected and can go into a feedback loop example i had a call recently about my side business that i was nervous about as the time for the call drew closer i got more nervous then i started to think who do you think you are to even try doing this which fed into my nervousness to the point where i felt queazy if i had allowed it to keep going i probably wouldve made myself sick i stopped myself when i realized what was happening used some exercises i learned in my meditations once i was able to calm emotions i focused my mind to preparing for the call giving it no room to explore what ifs it wasnt until later that i realized that once i was calm and focused my stomach settled as well my third step was to learn how to start gaining control of my mind body and emotions one of the techniques i use regularly is nasal breathing did you know that breathing though your nose and into your stomach engages the parasympathetic nervous system the sympathetic nervous system is responsible for the fight or flight response while the parasympathetic nervous system is more related to restoration and digestion so what does that mean when you engage the parasympethic nervous system you short circuit the sympathetic nervous system effectively halting the fight or flight response as an added bonus focusing on your breath takes your mind off of the situation for the moment helping to calm down and focus once you return your attention to the situation at hand i still have times where i get stressed and depressed but i know have steps to cope with it sometimes its a matter of lightening my load and other times its changing my focus from what if to something tangible to move myself forward i know how debilitating stress can be and i hope my experiencesongoing journey can help,1

finals and college applications are feeling like too much im fully aware that every student encounters stress around the time of finals but im completely overwhelmed honestly i feel cheated as well all my other friends in public school are skating by in all their classes talking about how they never have homework how their finals are so easy etc they go out live it up on the weekends and spend time with friends senior year is supposed to be my time to have fun the last chance to be a kid before going off to college im stuck at an insanely rigorous private school that assigns me hours upon hours of homework every night and even more over the weekend finals are cumulative meaning students are responsible for every detail of everything we have learned this year i could understand the reasoning for giving cumulative finals if broad concepts were being tested however its not just broad concepts its every date and every battle about which we have learned in history its every problem we have done in math and the same for every other subject it is all an unbelievable amount of material being required and i do not truly feel like i can manage it to make matters worse i am currently right on the line between letter grades doing well on my finals will pull me up and doing poorly will keep me down i would not normally be so stressed about finals but they are a kind of make it or break it thing at this point especially because certain colleges require my first semester transcript i just finished applying to the honors program at the college i will most likely be attending but i have been so swamped with work all the rest of my life that im not even sure i even want to embark on something else challenging i hear college is the place you make all your true friends find yourself and everything else like that i just fail to even comprehend this idea because all school has ever posed is stress it feels like all my life has ever posed is stress anyone who survived a rigorous and stressful high school experience please tell me im going to make it i expect the best of myself and hate myself when i cant deliver i lose my head when i get too stressed and i dont even feel like i know what im doing anymore,1

my teenage years will soon be over not a single happy memorable thing happened fuck but tell me yours though,1
everything is gray what scares me about my viewpoint on life is that i come off as very happy and try to stay happy and positive both internal and external however when i think about how mysterious this world is and how i wont ever find an answer to what this all is it and makes everything and why then even beautiful places and interesting people just seem blah even thinking about things that are accepted as just a part of life like sound and taste and colors even become disturbingly confusing and unexplainable its like yea this is nice but if this is all random then is it really even that wonderful or grandiose as we make it idk but i wish i could get past these thoughts and just live and enjoy i never really considered myself depressed primarily because i know titling yourself can make things worse so ive always told myself otherwise,1

severe stress i literally feel crippled cannot stop throwing up i am a 34 year old female i have had quite a year to say the least amidst all the other nonsense going on covid riots i am also in the middle hopefully near the end of a messy divorce with an extremely resentful ex no kids thankfully due to me moving out on my own i started to have some financial issues then it just seemed to snowball i got into a fender bender in my brand new car have to pay a 500 deductible and unfortunately still pay my car payment i was honestly hoping it would have been totaled and got me out from underneath the loan then i started to get a sinus infection and they made me test for covid which was negative but i had to take a week off work anyway i just cant seem to get it together and i literally feel like im killing myself with all this stress and nonsense i feel uncomfortable in my own skin all the time i get very disoriented and dumb feel like im in a dream debilitating anxiety muscle twitches specifically my right eye shaking exhaustion cant get my thoughts straight ever i seriously cannot remember if something actually happened lately or if i dreamed it and lately just throwing up constantly going to work is a nightmare im an insurance broker and have been for 4 years but ive missed a lot of work this year and all of my coworkers pretty much hate me the thought of sitting chained to my desk all day makes me crazy but i know i need to go because i need money its a nonstop shit show the only thing that seems to help is alcohol which trust me i know does not help i cant live like this anymore i know theres a happy fun girl in there but im so lost currently im on 100mg of zoloft which seems to be doing nothing i was taking mirtazapine briefly which is great for sleep but not so great if youre trying to watch your figure what are some things you guys do to manage your stress i literally feel like im losing my mind,1

been struggling with becoming healthy and my fiancee told me she was proud of me so ive lost weight before but sacrificed alot of my health to do so this time around i decided i was going to do it te right way which is the slow and difficult way instead of crash dieting for the quickest results i count every calorie that goes into my body bapance my micronutrients lift weights 3 times a week and train in martial arts 46 times a week i love what i am doing but some days can be particularly grueling this tuesday i came home after sparring and got really beat up i was very sore and bruised up so i was sitting silently at my desk chair kind of sulking my fiancee came over to me and told me she was proud of me out of the blue she told the fact that ive been going every night and working this hard amazed her she said it has nothing to do with the weightloss just the fact that i dont quit is what makes her proud i took a day off to heal up a bit and now i have a whole new reserve of motivation knowing that im making my family proud because thats all ive ever wanted im not married and dont have kids yet but i will soon i know this is something i need to do for my future family and it already seems to be paying dividends,0
i am searching for my path in life but cant seem to find it sorry ahead of time for the rambling on theres alot on my mind and its hard to put in words i am a 18yo male i recently graduated high school i am searching for my path in life but cant seem to find it throughout highschool i had 2 or 3 jobs part time gas station restaurant jobs that i actually did not hate after graduation i got a job working for a home building company making about 19hr doesnt sound bad until you are the one working the 50hr weeks lifting 250lb walls for 10 hours a day i just walked out on that job 3 days ago i couldnt take it anymore that job wouldve allowed me to move out of my parents home but it was way too much work for not enough money heaven forbid i have a kid or something and i wouldnt be able to afford bills and be able to care for the child at the same time so that job wasnt an option and the typical minimum wage 9 to 5 isnt an option im scared of going to college because of how poorly i did in highschool and the cost of it i researched gunsmithing trade schools however it seems like you can only get jobs that pay less than 20hr and its hard factory work im good at building computers but theres no job just for building computers guns and computers are the only thing im good at really i thought about working somewhere simple and then opening a liqour store when im 21 but it turns out that its extremely costly and difficult to get the proper licensing for that basically im asking is there any way i can start my own buisiness preferably firearms or computers that wont cost an arm and a leg to start up or if theres any jobs that pay well and dont make you want to die,1
isnt it weird to explain that youd rather feel sadness than nothing at all its so weird that feeling nothing is the new normal for many i used to think people were being super dramatic but that is really what it feels like i think when i feel better its not really like happiness its more so that empty feeling that could pass for happiness normality i keep trying to force tears just to feel something as dramatic as it sounds but nothing happens i can never cry naturally i have to force myself and the minute i stop focusing on it the tears dry up oops i feel isolated from everyone like i can see my family friends interacting but theres like this chain keeping me rooted in place if that makes sense all communication is too much effort let alone movement the feeling of nothingness is almost safer and more comfortable and reliable i kinda prefer it than being happy i guess happy makes me feel vulnerable or uncomfortable everything good and bad in life comes from feelings,1
anyone else find that while youre super hard on yourself youre almost too forgiving of others in my hardest moments of depression the thought monster convinces me that im worthless but that other people still have worth i also happen to be convinced that people are either lucky or unlucky and that theres really nothing we have any real control over because of this i can even see the people who do the most atrocious things as forgivable but with myself nothing is good enough every decision i make seems to be not good enough not worth enough to justify ongoing existence are there any things you do that work to remind yourself that thoughts do not necessarily equal truth,1
i have no motivation or will to live about 6 months ago i struggled seriously with selfesteem issues and suicidal thoughts i never told anyone about it and i never did anything to get over it i just sorta ignored it now i dont give a fuck about anything anymore all i do is go to the beach and drool over the same girl i have been chasing for months i have no motivation or fear of punishment i use to be a straight a student with a 45 gpa now i have like 15 missing assignments in every class whenever i am punished it doesnt bother me i cant take anything or anyone seriously even when my dad hits me for missing assignments or disrespecting him it doesnt even phase me im not scared of dying im not scared of pain im not scared of being homeless in the end none of it matters anyway is this normal i use to have a almost obsessive crush on a girl and now i still like her but i dont really care what she thinks of me anymore i use to do everything in order to impress her and now i just dont give a single fuck and like i said before i dont give a fuck about school anymore i was the kid who would stay after class and takes only ap and college classes and now i dont give a fuck if i end up homeless and without an education i was a d1 baseball player and might have a shot at college but idgaf about it anymore and ive started skipping practice for the past couple of months i still dont have my permit why would i need it if my friends could drive my mom was screaming at me about my grades and i laughed at her it seemed so stupid that some one was mad at me for a grade i just want to have a good time i started smoking weed again and drinking alone i know thats not healthy but no one knows any different so why not i think im gonna drop out and move in with my brother and if he doesnt let me move in with him ill just be homeless what the fuck am i supposed to do with myself what the fuck is wrong with me,1

i got extra credit on my science project probably nobody cares but im just sooo insanely proud of myself and i really want to talk about it we had to do a project on energy sources and i did a bunch of research on wind turbines and made a google slide and everything it was pretty interesting because i actually learned how they worked i was really nervous when i was presenting because i didnt know what they would think of my presentation because i thought it wasnt as good as the other ones but when i went to present its like my mind went blank and some weird part of my brain took over i started making jokes explaining in detail making up my own sentences without even using my slide project i opened my presentation with prepare to get blown away because it was on wind turbines and everyone laughed and then i went through every slide i had and explained it all way better than i thought i would i did stumble over a few words but it wasnt that bad heres the best part when i finished it was all silent for a second and then my science teacher said ashlyn that was awesome and then everyone was clapping i was the last person to present and the teacher didnt react that way even for the people who i thought had the best presentations im glad i was wearing a mask because nobody could see how teary i was getting and how much i was grinning then when i looked up my grade i saw he gave me 10 extra credit i dont know im just soooooo happy ive never been this proud of myself before,0
grieving for a time ill never get back i miss the days when my family would do things together and when i had friends to chat to looking back i was so much happier as a kid and i often find myself crying over old memories when i get in these depressive episodes i wish i was back at my childhood friends house or at my grandparents pool just to relive what it was like to be free content and happy its like nostalgia is at the root of my depression and although i still have both of my parents and siblings its not the same how do you cope with a life that is constantly changing when you want to stay in the past,1
why do i feel bothered and ashamed by things that sometimes happened literally over 10 years ago and the only person that probably remembers is me i woke up and immediately started looking for things to be bothered with im tired of this how do you do to let go of things,1

poverty and depression wont let me focus on career hi im new to this subreddit and this is a throwaway all ive known my entire life is poor and shitty conditions and i feel like i keep spiralling more and more everyday i have been on a downward spiral for a while which makes me distance myself from everyone and lose all motivation i live in a onebedroom apartment with my parents and i am almost 21 i want to make it out of here but then some days i worry about leaving my parents behind my dad is virtually unemployed now i want to help my family financially escape this shitty environment i wanted to be a doctor in high school but i wasnt particularly passionate about it i wanted to earn a lot of money and help my family escape poverty but the reality of taking out even more student loans doesnt seem that enticing anymore i have already accumulated an immense amount of student debt for a degree that leads to nowhere with minimal job prospects i have been thinking about doing law instead for a while now the anxiety of having to make a career decision keeps killing me inside so much so i cannot focus on anything without being hit by a shit load of stress i dont know where to turn to for help i have no one to guide me through this,1
i can feel that something incredible is happening in my life soon i wanted to put this down into words and share it i can feel myself all at once just coming into my own i dont know whats started i dont know when it was but something has happened where ive suddenly snapped come out of my shell and ive never felt more motivated in my life im ready to go to the gym tomorrow and make a real change im ready to go to college in two weeks and finally earn something more than gcses after 2 years of dropping college and sixth form it feels like somehow somewhere a huge weight has been lifted off my back yesterday i spoke to my oldest sister over a phone call for the first time in half a year it was a huge leap of faith i had no conversation topics pre thought up no alterations to my language no trying to be the best id seen a sentence about dancing how if you just focus on feeling it instead of thinking of the steps in your head it works and it worked and we spoke for 2 and a half hours effortlessly just talking i havent had a conversation like that in years where ive just been able to relax i cant put it into words at all all i can say is when something happens thats incredible ill be adding it to this post whether its a week month or year from now i love you all,0
do you experience depression question at the doctors office i went to the doctor for an annual checkup recently and one of the first questions the nurse asked in the initial screening in the exam room was something like do you experience depression i wanted to answer honestly because i do a lot of the time after some of the turns my life has taken so i said yes then the nurse looked at me and prompted me to take my answer back and change it to no by telling me that if i say yes that means like suicidal and i guess would be something theyd have to report the fact is i do think about suicide i mean ive never acted on it but its not like the thoughts dont cross my mind i just dont understand how we draw this firm clear line between normal people and depressed people and then if you outwardly manage your depression well enough they look at you like youre crazy for saying you are depressed even worse is that some caring wellmeaning person probably had the question added to the triage process in the first place but then in actual practice the person asking the questions pushes you to not answer the question honestly what is the point of even asking the question if you are just going to push people that experience depression and manage it the best they can to lie and say they dont i think my depression likely does have actual negative consequences for my overall health too that might be relevant to the medical exam thoughts,1

so stressed that im calm nonresponsive to it how to manage what am i experiencing i have a certain extremely important exam in a week today i realised i have only a week my colleagues are all freaking out and talking about it and i just feel numb to it i usually would cry it out and then push myself forward to work and get it done but my reaction today is alarming not just today but its been a while that i feel like im not in touch with my reality i cant seem to grasp the urgency of it even though i am so so so stressed out at the same time i have a lot of deadlines and things to do for this exam but i feel unusually nonresponsive like wheres my panic mode getting into that panicky state actually always helps me assess myself and i stop procrastinating and get into work mode but i just feel like im not even here im on autopilot and im not even panicking the way i always doshould be i am confused and i dont know how to word it correctly hope i make sense,1

why i think he was a narcissist he mentioned that ill have his kids shortly before having sex for the first time with him possessiveterritorial demanded my loyalty but had none towards me he used triangulation with another girl who was very nasty to me bullied me was in love with him he love bombed me hard silent treatment he discarded me for her then blocked her from everywhere obsessed with grandiosity constantly posting big events in the city flashy removes likes comments lies about things he shouldnt even lie about has a visceral reaction when i would call out his disrespectful behavior said he has a special bond with me and likes me but then abandons discards me the day after made me feel crazy tape recorder moments dr ramani talks abut this gaslighting,1
my stepmom and stepbrother finally moved in with me and my dad today were officially a complete family now sorry if i dont sound overly excited in the title lol its a lot to take in and its been a long day and especially a long week to get you all up to speed or feel free to read my previous posts from the beginning my dad has raised me pretty much all on his own from the beginning since my mom died giving birth to me he is basically the center of my world and who i love more than anything sure i have my boyfriend whom i also love to bits and he also makes me feel appreciated and cherished but me and my dad is something else and i dont know how i got so lucky to have him in my life that all being said though he started seeing a woman two years ago they went to high school and graduated together and reconnected through friends shes honestly made him happier than ive ever seen him a different kind of happy if that makes sense but she my stepmom has been through a lot also her then husband walked out on her and their son at some point and left her a single mom he would occasionally get in contact with her but as she described him hes the kind who just takes and takes and never gives she never said he abused them just that he wasnt a very good person but the biggest thing thats made me at least respect and like her is how she treats me from literally the first day she came to our house for dinner she saw me as her own she saw me and just said hi sweetheart and hugged me looking at me with the biggest smile on her face it was an odd feeling because i just never really felt any sort of motherly love like this before but fast forward to now and they have both finally moved in with me and my dad as of today the past two weeks have mostly been spent moving stuff over to our place little by little me and my dad went over to her place to get what was left id only been to her house a few times before and always liked it even though it was rather small one floor actually it was weird seeing it so empty and barren and it was especially hard for her to leave it all behind she stood at the front door for almost two minutes before finally having the strength to close it for good and even then the hard part wasnt over she said goodbye to all her neighbors who were waiting for her and even my stepbrother had to say bye to his friends that honestly got to me a little bit seeing all of them crying but somehow we got through it and went home my stepmom holding my hand the whole way there and thats about all i feel like sharing for now though some of you are probably wondering if i love her my stepmom and honestly i do i respect and care about her deeply like everyone else in my life and am beyond happy to have her so happy that now i cant imagine being without her i really mean that but i dont know if im ready to call her mom yet i had one and i know i love her even though i never met her its complicated and im sorry if i make it sound that way but hey im happy and everyones happy and thats whats important technically shes not my stepmom yet since they havent gotten married but you get the idea my dad has also already framed a photo of him and her that they took in the living room where hes hugging her from behind and they each have the biggest smiles on their faces its beautiful i know my stepbrother is kind of iffy about the whole situation also but already likes my dad and i think the two of them are going to become quite close if i think of any more details to add in ill try and edit this when i get the chance thanks for reading,0
despite all downfalls and against everything i couldnt be happier with how things are going happy with myself and how lucky i am to date the man of my dreams super new to reddit but in all honesty i read this reddit as often as i do my religious studies and after seeing everyone share their joy never fails to make me smile so i want to share mine as well btw im not a native english so if sentences dont make sense you now know why i have known my now boyfriend ever since we were in middle school he met me during one of the hardest times of my life as a kid i found out im incurably ill at a very young age not something that will be fatal on long term but quality of life is severely reduced as kids his company was one i enjoyed alot everytime in all my years of meeting people ive never consistently been able to enjoy someones presence years pass we change i did not for the better for a long time stuff got to me and i got bitter which til this day i wish i realised how down bad i was im still thinking about how i couldve been better however we remained friends but through my act i made him feel not loved with my rough attitude one day i realised just how poorly i was doing and treating those around me because i got so bitter after alot of things happened i realised i didnt want to be like this anymore and lost myself over the years i distanced myself from every thing stopped using my phone computer and consoles as a whole as i started to do some self reflection and learn alot of times passes i wrote down his info to pick up contact again after i bettered myself before i took a trip i promised him that when im ready i would soon greet him again going back to people i once knew was harder than ever all i thought of was how people perceived me and how i was like before i saw in how i was i struggled contacting him but after months of contemplating i did it and i couldnt call him that man singlehandedly changed his phone number dammit so after contacting some other people who knew both of us they gave me his new info i messaged him scared whether he would accept me or not and to my suprise he did i explained to him everything that went on in my mind and how i look back on myself from that point on things improved even beyond what i thought being around him has made me learn even more and eventually i felt things were getting a bit awkward in a pinch and desperate effort i told him that i liked him alot and just needed to get it off my chest because the awkwardness that i felt i would be fine if he didnt feel the same i knew what risk i would take because if he didnt feel the same at all well we all know where that can go and he said he liked me back and that he always did ever since we were young i dont know how to transition from this point on in my writing but life has been so good we can talk about things i can be myself even if i am rather childish he always loves seeing me happy and doing what i want to do he appreciates the transparency of our relationship and that we can talk about every little thing that bothers us and its okay we respect eachother and dont mock eachother we listen to each others feelings and improve from that point on even if he has odd passions i love them seeing his interest and pure joy he finds in a hobby i cant help but smile ive had some confrontations with people who hate my guts rightfully so its okay that theyre mad and i understand it motivates me even more to better myself ive been invested in my roots languages and beliefs my health has hit a downfall and i cant do much anymore i no longer work and had to take care of myself hes here to support me through it the path to recovery and getting my health back together will take a long ass time but hey atleast im with a guy who told me he thought he was going to marry me when we were 10 the biggest lessons ive learned and i hope someone can learn from these as well respect and equal treatment is important you never know what someone is going through so never snap at someone because you have your own bad day consistent effort and showing you care builds long term bonds its okay to be tired but be sure to talk about how you feel and those who really appreciate you will understand how you feel and last but not least perception do not work yourself up over something someone said if someone comes off rude i guarantee most of the time someone just worded it poorly and even if it was meant to hurt you teaching yourself how to perceive the world and things around you will make even such things wont affect you anymore youll feel more joy and your quality of life will significantly increase when you start to smile at strangers and see everything in a positive light the moment you start doing it it becomes natural and will only become a better and more dominant trait over time oh and do it for yourself make changes you want to change like investing in a subculture thats not socially desirable but youve always admired investing and developing interests will make you feel more confident i play drums but also love knitting sweaters and im proud of these drastically different hobbies oh and really the last one tell them that you like them trust me on that one sorry i treated this like a diary entry but maybe someone enjoys reading it haha i still suck at writing a last reminder for those who need it know that youre loved surround yourself with people who make you feel loved and do not feel afraid to leave and start over again and you can finally start fresh it helps im proud of you and you should be proud of yourself as well little steps always count up to something bigger,0

im very stressed and i know why but what can i do about it please help me im a 21 year old man right now i have summer break but i still feel as if im always working 247 i never enjoy anything in life im also depressed and i have many mental issues and im always tired and unmotivated about everything and every single day feels as a heavy work day even if i am at home having free time there are 2 reasons of my high stress reason 1 is being an unhappy single and reason 2 is trying so hard to find someone which costs alot of effort and time before you read this i am not here for dating advice so please dont unless you have a magic trick that will 100 sure work for me since 4 years ago when i was 17 i started developing interest in girls now 21 i still never had a relationship but even worse i never had a date or even a female friend even though i have tried different strategies which i failed i never hugged a girl either i have exactly 0 experience with girls why am i so stressed it is because those 4 years first of all being single makes me unhappy and second i have been trying very hard to find a girl to get the first date in my life or to even make a female friend every single day i waste my time on dating i mean endless swiping apps read neverending swiping but never getting a match asking on reddit how to get a girlfriend asking google how to get a girlfriend thinking about being single forever you know what i mean i waste alot of my time and energy in doing research about how to find a girlfriend but trust me i have really tried going outside and trying out dating apps i really tried stuff too nothing works so how can i feel less stressed 1 find the love of my life and be happy but this wont happen any time soon it seems impossible so what can i do to get my mind off the impossible i really have hobbies and interests i have a life so thats not the problem here the only missing part in my happiness is having a girlfriend i feel very frustrated and tired and stressed and im starting to hate life seeing guys getting girlfriends as if its the easiest thing in the world just makes me angry these days even 10 year old kids have relationships i guess my purpose on earth is just to be a loser i am so obsessed with dating and trying everything that i have no more focus on anything else in my life i dont care about family anymore i dont care about my friends anymore i dont care about my hobbies anymore i dont care about study anymore i dont care about anything except i just want a girlfriend how can i be happy without having a partner really i have study i have a great family i have friends i have a hobby my life is fine except for being girlfrienddeprived which really bothers me alot it seems impossible to focus on anything else than how to get a girlfriend is there anything i can do to feel more happy and relaxed and stop hating life whenever i play videogames or do whatever to relax and try to enjoy it doesnt really make me happy because my frustration of being single and fear or being single forever stays in the background of my thoughts no matter what im doing or focusing on and whenever i try to relax or study or do anything i feel guilty towards my dating life thinking if i dont take action i will never find a partner what should i do to feel happy and not frustrated and stressed am i asking for the impossible here because honestly i thikn there is no way i can be happy without a partner i just have this desire and its really strong and its growing stronger i cant just remove my desire can i edit please dont tell me to get therapy or medication i already tried that and just no therapy would also take even more of my time and energy which i dont have this year,1
ive been depressed since i was 13 and its all because of my parents ever since i was a little kid my parents were always toxic and they havent really changed much i was never really allowed to have friends or get too close to anyone for the purpose that people are bad which i understand now that people are bad but i feel like the lost sheep and i cant even socialize and im 19 ive had depression and depersonalization and anxiety for as long as i can think of to this day i still do and this is no way of living i try to have a good relationship with my parents but then i remember all the past times and the feelings resurface they would always threaten me that if i had fights at school that they would kick me out but in reality people were the ones starting things with me i had no one to express myself to and my family only made fun of me and told me i was lying i told them i had a condition called trichotillomania and they denied it and said that im lying i would fill in my eyebrows with makeup because i wanted to hide the spots from where i pulled my hair out in return i got made fun of and told that i look stupid instead of providing me with professional help of course when i have all these outbursts its because ive lived my life in humiliation and grief and never did someone offer to help me through the darkest period of my life i feel like ive been living in hell they have bullied me so much in my life that i cant even function like a mentally stable person and i cant do anything about it because they buy me food and pay for my things so i will be seen as ungrateful and then i will be blamed again now i wont say that ive been a perfect child either but growing up i was surrounded by bad and abusive people so i became stubborn and sometimes got into trouble but i was only young and was expected to act like i know everything which is impossible and a good parent would be better at teaching their child but why expect your child to be perfect when your child lives around parents who fight all the damn time and hit each other but i cant take it anymore and i cant continue ignoring the fact that ive had a horrible past and its the reason why my mental health is so bad i cant even make it through the first month of college without wanting to give up because of how hard everything is and no one even fucking listens they all just have high expectations of you and not having self esteem or friends or confidence just makes everything worse shouldve just offed myself a long time ago cause theres no recovery from this illness ever its gonna be a long road of misery,1
relationship stress f20 hello ive been in my current relationship for approximately 5 months and its weird i dont find any aspect of the relationship bad or unhealthy except that im quite over invested in it and i dont know how not to be because investing emotionally and mentally into that person is important for me but its made me a very stressed out person to the extent that it has impacted my health periods skin etc and im not sure how to deal with it naturally other parts of my life contribute things like academics and work but those are things i have no option but to cope with my relationship is a choice and often times amid the stress i wonder if its the right choice in this very moment in time any advice is appreciated,1

i think my wife saved my life this morning i have severe anxiety taking meds but theyve kind of stopped working like they used to got into a conversation with my wife yesterday and i mentioned if i were to be in a place where i could just sit still and not have my brain worry about something i dont know what i would do with myself anyway i dont get into depressive moods too often anymore it this morning 3 days before our 5th anniversary vacation we never take vacations never have the money i check my bank account and realize that all of the bills i had planned to come out last week all hit at once and put our account into the negative by quite a bit i panicked my wife had been looking forward to a small trip to chattanooga to just relax for months the kid was to stay at my parents house and we were just going to relax for a few days when i realized i messed up the timing on our bills i spiraled i absolutely lost control and cried lost it it was probably the worst i have ever felt i was crying for about 10 minutes when i suddenly had this sense of calm wash over me suicide easy i got out of bed suddenly stoped crying cleaned my face up and began getting dressed i told my wife i was going out for a little while she knew something was going on and refused to let me leave the house she physically grabbed me made me look her in the eyes and told me everything was fine it brought me out of my head i dont know if its something that i would have gone through with but in that moment it was the most ok i had ever been with the idea of suicide we still dont have the money for the trip but thats ok i know i have someone looking out for me sorry for the rambling but i figured i just needed to get it out of my head,1
i dont matter do i life hasnt been very well lately and its not even just because of quarantine all of my life ive felt really alone and like everythings just been a blur maybe its a mood im in right now but my stress and frustration has been so high and i need an outlet to just let it all out because its so fucking frustrating i feel like in falling into this void with no return and im writing to let out letters in hopes that one person just one person can hear me i can see myself falling behind as people go ahead of me and are passionate about things they want to do maybe its because i dont have as much human interaction anymore and my internet never fucking works so im just sitting on my chair trying to get some type fo signal to do the smallest thing but i feel like im dying fuck fuck fuck i hate it the worst part is that its my fault this is on me yea sure my feelings are valid or whatever but man it hurts a lot and most days i cant see the end of this hurt im not suicidal anymore which is nice but the biggest reason that was pushing me on was that i could be with the people i love the most but i cant go out people left im stuck i cant talk to anybody because either they want to be alone or they are too busy i feel like im falling i cant find enjoyment in the things i use to do how do i even start to feel better,1

advice on depression i think ive been struggling with depression for the last couple of years ive wanted to kill myself but honestly just have never been able to work up the courage to do it i want to be able to talk to my family about this but we dont talk about mental health or anything even remotely similar at a certain point i kind of gave up on talking to them and just decided i was going to deal with it until i graduated college and could afford to send myself to therapy however i kind of realized that the chances i was going to make it until then arent great so i would probably need to do something before that being the case i wanted to ask if anyone had any advice on how to talk to my family and how to ask for their support,1

my upbringing i dont know yet if this text is selftherapeutic or im looking for opinions probably both like always my upbringing was fine my parents dont fit together too well and their relationship is nowhere the definition of healthy but there was no physical violence we went to vacation and we had enough money to buy everything a family needs with that being said i never developed a deep emotional relationship to my parents i never talked about emotional issues with them or emotions and feelings in general myself evolved into a egotistical and narcissistic personality as soon as i hit the age 68 i have no clue whyi definitely developed a fragile ego until i was 10 but things just started there i was still one a high horse in my class i was the first boy with a gf 14yo i was in love with her but 45 months into the relationship i got kinda bored and ended it i restarted it a few times because i was impressionable the bigger and older guys in my basketball group said i did a mistake but a few months later i was still abusing her love for me just to make out you see a very fragile but selfcentered ego the next 2 years i continued having relationships with girls i also changed school because i was lazy as fuck in retrospect this was the worst decisions of my life with 1617 i started going to parties i got wasted a lot i met my todays best friend i also met this boy he was from my old school same year but different class therefore i didnt know him yet we were chatting a lot we hit it off immediately and very soon i realized i like boys he gave me weird signals we cuddled and so on but eventually he made it clear he is not gay the last 2 sentences outline like 67 months maybe more when we were at friends we cuddled we played footsie it never happened much more at least nothing i have to add here as i said eventually i told him he said nope unfortunately we still met and even more unfortunately we still cuddled i couldnt finish this story and this is when things heated up i got wasted more and more i got drugged up i cant specifically remember the precise timeline after intense alcohol sessions and weed mdma arrived as well i did way too much mdma amphetamines methamphetamines cocaine medicaments acid ketamine everything i wasnt addicted to one specific substance back then i was just permanently drugged up of course wrong friends joined my life the good old circle appeared which our parents have been warning us since weve been kids suppressing my emotions was the target and i cant say i didnt achieve that the rock bottom was new years eve my best friend said were done until im not completely insane anymore since the boy i fell in love became very good friends with my best friend and we were going to parties altogether i got extremely jealous i tried to separate them i got aggressive this led to the message of my best friend on new years eve luckily i had a few brain cells left and this was a turn point in my life i tried to get my shit together over the next 5 years i did less and less drugs i wasnt as pretty as before because i fucked up my body so i also looked for a healthy life style i was very insecure of my look for years i didnt date anyone even though i believed i had overcome him i didnt care anymore when he was around i passively began to dislike him the last 3 years i was catching up my a level since i left the school with 14 and i only did 10 years of school instead of 12germany in this time span my main issue was weed i smoked for 3 months then i was literally sober for 25 months not even drinking coffee or a beer i repeated that several times i barely saw this boy the past years 2 months ago i finished my a level i also was sober for 10 months and besides school i was working 160 hours as a nurse in an elderly hometo this day after the exam i obviously started smoking weed again but this time not the whole day without going to work only after work only one joint well it bored me that much that i flushed down 50 bucks of weed i guess weed is history but a few weeks ago i saw him and what can i say but the first cut is the deepest its been 7 years and i still love him never believed he is not interested in boys i think the past years when i tried becoming a better me i actually got a few emotions back the past two months i became more pretty again i healed i felt the higher testosterone floating through my body my interest in relationships increased tho i didnt look for it now when i met him i guess i just realized i never closed this chapter the next few days i was high af on him and weed i still smoked back then then the low point eventually appeared and i dont know i feel like shit now depressed i dont care if i die tomorrow i dont care if i go to jail the past years i had actual symptoms of antisocial personality disorder no im not that edgy kid who thinks sociopaths are cool id kill someone to start again in 2016 to avoid evolving into something like today i had intense anger breakouts i physically hurt my mommy i destroyed a door in my anger i became such a good liar and manipulator i know which buttons to press in people i committed a few crimes no severe ones ok one time i was one 700mcg acid and i had to call the ambulance because i low kicked the leg of a paramedic they had to call the police i also got violent towards the police and eventually ended up in the icu my arms and legs were fixed to the bed for safety reasons i also lacked empathy i had much darker thoughts too but i wont type em here im honestly concerned im so depressed atm but im also extremely motivated at the same time i wanna finally date someone sports every day i read nearly 2 non fictions book per week i wanna go to university but im also depressed and if id die tonight id be actually okay with it i want him i dont understand why it never happened when i met him a few weeks ago i thought he flirted with me but i lack empathy and im insane i would not even say im 30 sure sorry for my english im german and i didnt try too hard i tried to make it as short as possible many details are missing no clue why i post this here,1

ive made myself bitter and cynical to shield myself from the fact that im terribly lonely and jealous of other people getting to experience love and friendship yeah thats basically what it boils down to that and i believe i am a horrible person who is unworthy of those things and i wouldnt even know how to be a real friend or lover anyway because i am so monumentally screwed in the head so i tell myself oh those people theyre not really friends they dont really love each other that much its just for show when theres no one recording they hate each other just as much as everybody does but in my heart of hearts i know the truth its not them its me,1

nothing special just another guy tired of life ive been living with clinical depression for several years my depression episodes comes and go but recently ive been in a constant state of anxiety because of work the reason is because im currently stuck in a loop of not motivated to do anything being bad at what i do because of lack of motivation sad and hate myself for being useless not wanting to do anything because im sad and hate myself tbh i dont even want for the situation to be better i just want to be nonexistent i dont care how dropping dead out of nowhere suicide murdered or even someone going back in time and make sure i was never born i dont have the courage to resign because then all my workload would be transfered to someone else and ill feel bad knowing that someone else has to suffer because of me which would probably feed into my depression more i cant see any future for me im tired,1

grey hair suddenly hi all i know that researchers found that stress causes morefaster greying of hair but wanted to share my experience and see if anyone else had experienced this first hand as well almost 12 months ago now i went through an incredibly traumatising and permanently life changing experience i have since suffered what could only be described as ongoing severe emotional stress which only now is showing the slightest signs of easing before the event i had no grey hair on my head about 4 months after the event a lot of greys started growing in and this has progressively gotten worse it is now almost twelve months later and i would say around a third of all hairs on my head are now grey my skin and face look much older as well now but the speed of the change on my head has shocked us all anyway i definitely agree with the findings linking stress to rapid greying has anyone else experienced something like this and how quick did it come on,1

i went to mental hospital and got better so i was very sceptical about mental hospitals because in my country they have an extremely poor reputation and people who were there almost always said to me dont go there but i did and got better i was in a open department so it felt like being in a summer camp stuff was really friendly i didnt like the insane amount of drop counters and needles in general but our medical system uses them everywhere suicidal thoughts followed me everywhere i wanted to move to another country or at least to another part of city to escape them but i understood that they are a part of me by now first time in four years ive got a day when i dont think about killing myself in a serious way i feel so relieved i feel lighter than air,1
fell off the boat relapsed back into depression just a reminder for those that you should always be on top of your depression even when you dont feel it long story short a few years ago i checked myself into an outpatient center to get my depression under control it worked wonders and it was the best thing ive ever done for myself after i got out i was seeing a regular therapist however i was stuck in a toxic job that kept on triggering my depression and fucking up my recovery found a promising new job but that one ended up being even more toxic met my current bf at that time and he convinced me to quit and it was the only job i ever rage quit and told the people to fuck off felt good ended up being a great choice because i decided to get my cdl and its been awesome so far really got my shit in gear the job is fun as hell i make really good money its challenging in all the right kind of ways where you get these little senses of accomplishment here and there me and my bf also have a home together and its great but back to my point about staying on your treatment sometime inbetween going from the one toxic job to the other i stopped seeing my psychologist i was losing my health insurance at the time but i was on such a high from getting this new job it didnt bother me long story short went through that hole toxic episode and a severe down but i blamed it on the job and not the depression once i got my cdl i was actually feeling happy and great depression is an asshole though and knows how to creep back in now that ive been driving semis for close to 2 years the job has gotten very routine and i started falling back into old thought processes the ones were all familiar with they start slow like a dropping pipe until the pipe eventually bursts so you really dont notice it but theyre there that one small familiar though eventually grows routes until you relapse like i did and youre back in that dark place with no escape thats where im at now gotta almost start from 0 again luckily i have much more control on it and know what to do but still this is something you truly got to actively manage everyday even when you dont feel you need to because it will creep back up at some point just always stay active and watch the warning signs so you dont spiral we can beat depression but we all need to remember to stay active and progressive,1

i sold my guns they originally belonged to my grandpa im not a hunter but we used to go out target shooting and i was a pretty good marksman when he died he left me two of his old rifles theyve mostly sat locked in my closet ever since worth a lot of money but unable to let go of them partly out of sentimentality but id come to realize that i also felt compelled to keep them around for more troubling reasons my depression has been lifelong and ive had varying degrees of success fighting it recently things have been okay but ive had a nightmare of a time with intrusive thoughts impulses to do things i dont even want to do would pop in to my head at the worst times and i would fixate on the details of the aftermath until i would bring myself either to tears or to panic what if i just went up there and did it would my wife be better off in the long run would the friends i havent spoken to in years show up this is shit i do not need running through my mind two years ago i was feeling better i was finally getting serious about art and photography again i actually started selling prints and even had a little space in a local gallery for my work then the grey returned and i started seeing less and less worth going out to see then the darkness came back and i became convinced that those things i used to see and enjoy were gone now and nothing good was on the horizon so last week i made a decision packed up the guns all the ammo i had left and drove to the sporting goods store i got 2200 cash for the pair of guns and on the way home i stopped by best buy and bought myself a fujifilm xt3 for just around 2000 later that evening the intrusive thoughts returned as i tried to think about dinner what if i just went up there and then it cut off the pressure was gone went up there and what grabbed the camera ive always wanted and started taking pictures i did i cursed the cold bundled up grabbed my new gear and lost myself in the woods taking pictures of snowflakes and a family of deer that happened to wander though ive been shooting the camera for the last week and i cant put it down i feel something im really fucking good at this and im motivated to do it my worst impulses have been stopped in their tracks and replaced by the desire to improve and surprise myself its always going to be a struggle for me and i know that but i feel free in a way that i never really expected also posted in rgettingoverit if its not allowed to post in two subs let me know and ill delete,1

the fact that im supposed to keep living and im not allowed to kill myself annoys me honestly if i dont wanna keep going why should i i had no choice in my birth and i dont have a choice really in my death either i mean i could off myself but no one would really respect my choice i dont know i dont get much joy out of life i never really had much of a chance to i get some but i dont know if its worth going on and on forever i hate all of the obligations there are to stay alive i stay alive mostly for other people i know thats important i wish i could be selfish and die i used to think growing up that once my parents both died id just kill myself too i feel like that might still be a good plan for me i have goals and desires as well as things i want to do but i also dont really enjoy life this is all selfish im aware perhaps its wrong of me to think this way but i feel resentment towards my existence resentment towards the obligations and feelings i hold towards others resentment of my love for them and their love for me i daydream about becoming a major asshole to everyone just so i can off myself and have people celebrate my death but i also cant bring myself to be a jerk,1

looking for advice worried about sos health using a throwaway account for privacy reasons im m30 really worried about my sos f29 health and could really do with some advice ill put a tldr at the bottom im not sure if any of this content may be triggering so i apologise if it is some context we have been together nearly 10 years lived together for 6 before that we did long distance for 2 years long distance was hard and during that time my so was going through what she calls a hypochondriac stage in which she was always worrying about her health and scared she was going to get ill after we moved in together that worry subsided and things were ok i suffer from mild anxiety too so we both had our bouts every now and then but great other than that she would always think very low of herself though especially her appearance and her weight whenever we went anywhere 910 times she would have a break down about what she would be wearing which often made us late or led to an argument or general stress fast forward a few years just before covid she suffered the loss her step mother who wasnt even 50 this was obviously devastating but did lead to her and her dad becoming closer then covid hit and as such she has never fully had time to grieve for her step mum on top of that in june her dad announced that he had met someone else in november he said they were moving in together two weeks ago he announced they were getting married the way that he announced all of these was either very nonchalantly over zoomphone call or in a very grandiose way expecting congratulations im sure obviously my so and her sister are appalled and her dad doesnt quite seem to understand why on top of that he is so wrapped up in his own life that he isnt taking the time to ask how my soher sister are feeling about its very messed up and im furious at him so thats two reasons why she is feeling particularly stressed at the moment the third is work we are both key workers and as such have been going into work throughout the last year when others were wfh on top of that her work has been insanely busy and she is working on average 11 hour days and the work still isnt done the team she manages are not pulling their weight and management from what i can gather seem quite useless and keep promising solutions but never deliver she doesnt want to quit mainly because finding a job in this uncertain climate will be stressful too and in the somewhat likely event that redundancies are made itll probably be a first in first out situation her day of anxiousness usually goes as follows wake up feeling stressed about work and about what to wear will sometimes have a break down at work overloaded with workload will go to the bathroom to cry in the evening will come home stressed after a bad day at night will worry about sleeping and as a result will often have a big break down if she cant sleepgets woken up these break downs range from having trouble breathing to hurting herself thankfully never seriously but she has given herself scratches and bruises etc additionally there are certain words that might trigger her like if i mention anything about breathing her chest goes tight or if i suggest we go to bed earlier she becomes panicked about sleeping i have suggested apps such as headspace but she says they dont work and she doesnt want to go on medication im really worried about her and feel awful that i dont really know how to help im worried that one day she is going to badly hurt herself she has never expressed anything about being suicidal so im not worried about that more just badly hurting and also worried that quite frankly she could give herself a heart attack or something its also obviously having an effect on me as every evening im on edge not wanting to trigger a reaction in anyway and feel absolutely rotten if i do but admittedly the whole situation also makes me feel very angry not necessarily at her but just likewhy is this happening i hope that makes sense and doesnt make me sound like an asshole im just at a loss with what to do i love her more than anything and am just so worried about her so any advice could be greatly appreciated thank you tldr so is having panic attacks nearly every night and day is extremely stressed and im worried about her heatlh,1
i feel like depression has made me less smart i dont think about much anymore the things i do think about are unimportant because of this i dont have anything intelligent to say im not funny or clever or smart i probably seem very stupid and shallow and boring and i dont like this i wish i had the motivation to find things interesting and not be so onedimensional and dull,1
i dont know how to stay positive with the chronic illness im going through the last year but specifically it became severe the last 2 monthsi have severe gerd and lpr ive been in pain constantly my sleep has sucked it hurts to speak it hurts to breathe every meal i eat is basically a time bomb if i mess up and have anything remotely acidic even a minor ingredient my esophagus begins digesting itself and i can see sores develop that still havent healed its hard to eat my diet is restrictive it hasnt helped im young and healthier than most this is bullshit im on the strongest meds they have to suppress acid ppi at this point i really think surgery is my only hope if you can even call it that reading stories online lots of people had great success but others have been left with the same symptoms its been a recent dream to sing i want to be able to finally express myself especially considering my damaged childhood but my stupid body is falling apart and i cant unless this gets fixed i know it can transform my life and its what my heart is dying for but i need this to get fixed i dont know how to stay positive here anymore i dont know how people can do this deal with a chronic illness my social life is gone my days consist of watching tv trying to eat between the pain and counting down the day until the next doctor test hoping for an answer but they just say yep lets order this next test see you in 3 weeks mother fucker that and they act like surgery isnt a good fix which translates to me as you have no hope i wish i were fat because then i could at least lose weight and get it fixed that way im not going to live like this i want it all or nothing i need to be able to sing and this whole thing just makes me so mad and defeated and it pisses me off that im so healthy but genetics or whatever just wants to ruin my life i thought i had maybe 20 more years of good health but right now its looking really really bad i guess i just needed to vent or talk with somebody i dont know,1

stress is remaining stationary while processing thoughts like a factory undoing a yarn ball skating on a halfmelted pond trying and failing to fit a square in a circle separating the chocolate from the milk a twosteering wheel car the very bottom of the mountain an island of salvation a malfunctioning computer a dog tugging on the leash never resurfacing the warning of the garbage truck,1

casually suicidal do you ever look at yourself in the mirror and think about death you think about the consequences of it and what peoples views are on it maybe you have even considered suicide you brush it off most likely that is what most people do people are scared i am scared who would actually want to die though right this is what casually being suicidal is can you have suicidal thoughts and want to die at the same time i have a fear of death i always have always will how is it that some days i want everything to end but i dont at the same time its my biggest fear but also my biggest relief my biggest wish in reality i just want the pain to stop why is everything so difficult sure you would tell me to go get therapy go get tested by a psychologist or something as if that advice means anything you want to label us as if everyone feels the same thing people like this are the same in some ways sure they are but most people dont want to die they want it to stop what exactly do they want to stop people people are predictable what other reasons are there for someone to want to go as far as think these awful thoughts even good people turn bad everyone is bad even me people tell you to talk to others about these feelings that it will help but only people who experience these kinds of thoughts would understand and even then it would give them this negative thing to relate to is that really a good thing to relate in wanting to die back to my point what can people do i cant call myself depressed because im not sad all the time i cant say i have anxiety because im not anxious all the time it goes on the point of this paragraph is to say dont tell people to ask for advice or say that you understand what they are going through i always tell people what im going through they brush it off talking about it can help but only for the right people for people like me i dont exactly know if i have specific mental health to blame everything on im just feeling like this thats all for all the comments im sorry i cant reply to them all but i will try to when i get round to it but i want to say this now for anyone who will be reading in the future please feel free to pm me ill always reply didnt realise this would blow up but it is nice to know people feel the same way i hope you find some sort of comfort in that as i do stay safe someone shared this link with me if you want you can read it,1

im going out with my celebrity crush the title is pretty selfexplanatory just to clarify shes not like a celebrity but i dont know what else to call her she used to sing in a band that was once quite popular in this area but has since disbanded and shes now a bit off the radar shes a bit older than i am but weve had this cool communication over the messages through the years which started by me hitting her up as a fan but has since grown to become quite friendly we live a bit far apart but im going to travel close to her soon so i decided to bravely hit her up and ask to meet her to which she said yes and was really really nice like dont get me wrong its not a date or anything but im really excited because her music really helped me through the years inspired my own works and ive followed her for a very long time since she seems like a really fun interesting and awesome person and i cant wait to have the privilege to have a few drinks with her due to her low radar status ill respect her and not share her identity here just so it doesnt cause an awkward situation or ruin anything im excited happy and i hope she turns out to be na awesome person,0

im probably getting back together with my old girlfriend from middle school tomorrow night and i havent been this happy in years my friends are so tired of hearing me gush about this but i cant stop talking about it so im coming to reddit instead so way back in middle school i was dating this girl and thats the happiest ive ever been she was my absolute best friend ever since first grade and by the time we were twelve we were girlfriends none of our parents would have been okay with that heck my parents didnt even like me being friends with a mexican girl so even though all i wanted to do was tell everyone how amazingly in love i was we had to keep it to ourselves i still have vivid memories of how good it felt to lay with my head on her lap and let her stroke my hair while we watched tv in my room or spending too much time together in the school library making fun of the grownup books for being boring or all the awkward tense beautiful moments when we were alone and i was trying to figure out if now was a good time to kiss her which of course it never was she was my absolute best friend still is and i know its not healthy but ive always compared every relationship ive ever had to her not that ive had many anyway halfway through seventh grade she was gone her family moved to mexico because her grandpa in yucatan was getting older and needed her mom to come back and take care of him we had about a months worth of notice before she was just out of my life and to this day i dont think i ever really got over it my parents wouldnt let me have a cell phone or social media or anything until i turned sixteen so staying in contact was hard and eventually we just stopped fell out of touch and i wasnt okay for a really long time i couldnt have another relationship with a girl because my brain kept telling me she was going to disappear on me i tried liking guys because it was easier in a lot of ways but im definitely not straight so that wasnt happening i wound up falling into a pretty bad depression that im still not out of but therapy and medication have made things a lot better then six months ago we ran into eachother again totally by happenstance turns out we both wound up going to the same college even though its about a thousand miles away from where we grew up weve been living in the same town for almost three years and we didnt even know she had classes with a friend of mine and he would talk about her to me and i never even considered that the girl he was talking about could maybe be the same girl i grew up with i saw them leaving class together one day and even then i didnt know she recognized me though the look of absolute shock on her face god and the way she hugged me so tight when i was just frozen there i was always worried that she didnt miss me as much as i missed her and even though i think she dealt with it a lot better than i did i know thats not true now weve spent the last six months catching up and becoming friends again and im on top of the moon i actually havent been this happy in years and tomorrow night im going to ask her to go out with me again and of course im terrified but i know shes going to say yes im so excited i could scream and i can actually tell people now i can hold hands with her while walking down the street i can rest my head on her shoulder while sitting on a park bench we can get married if we want to god i could talk about this for hours and hours and hours so if anybody wants to dm me and talk some more i definitely wouldnt complain either way i hope my happiness made you guys a little happier today update she kissed me yall ive got a girlfriend and im freaking out,0

im 36 and stuck in years of misery depression is my self identity now and i dont know how to change it planet earth literally seems pointless and i dont know how billions of people can just live these meaningless lives ive had depression such a long time and i too feel like its too late to achieve anything meaningful with my life or even become the most basic description of what most people would consider a moderately successful adult im 39 working this grocery store job that literally cannot advance anywhere and it barely covers the bills but it does enough for me to live on my own which im grateful for that is a success i guess but ill be honest as well the job is fucking miserable all day customer service orientated for snobby rich healthobsessed and trendy people being stuck at this job its the best money i can find now literally makes me want to kill myself when i leave a shift there ive got a manager right now who hates me and if you know what constructive discharge means that is what seems to be happening at work so anyway i recently got hurt at work and typing at and using a computer at home like this is about the only thing ive been able to do for about two weeks now to interact with anyone i cant drive very much while hurt like this so it really sucks like i can barely manage to make a trip to the store for some basic shit i need i have to get completely whacked on medication which can be fun if you like it but i dont like it when it is involuntary to try to do anything physical around the house like i had to do this one thing or id get a fine and even then it is just so painful and hard to move it will probably be this way another couple weeks but maybe i can heal faster i dont know it seems like doctors where i am just will not prescribe pain medication anymore because there are too many people abusing it so now i cant get some pain meds when i legit need them which just reminds me of another stupid aspect of our society failing i really dont see much point in my living at all when i am just going through the motions of life but im miserable i can get by financially so far but i dont want to just get by while i feel shitty and useless and unable to advance myself i hate it and there is no point to living this way and theres several billion people living out this same lifestyle right now i dont know how so many people are ok with these pointless lives i guess they are happy enough with that i am not ok with it at all hurting my family is the only reason i am waiting or havent already gone through with it we dont get along so great right now but i would still never want to hurt them in that way i gotta add just to be honest and inclusive that i have anxiety as bad as i have depression its almost agoraphobic like it is actually becoming a fear of leaving my house for the million things that could go wrong being stuck here i am not happy but i guess i am safe i shouldnt have to live like this no one should thanks,1

keeping myself alive is just so much work for so little reward my parents dont understand how i could be so lazy that i never want to heat up any of my food to make it taste better i just think the difference in taste isnt a big enough reward for the amount of effort it takes similarly grooming does not seem worth it at all unless i have to go somewhere and even then sometimes i just put a hat on and call it a day i just wish my brain would reward me with happy chemicals for getting shit done the way its supposed to because it feels like every day i just wake up and wait for the day to be over already,1

initiated a fun conversation with a stranger and overcame a fitness fear im feeling really good as im writing this i am genuinely proud of how i handled myself these past two days in two separate situations trying to get over a bit of a slump so i forced myself to go on more walks around the city and parks to hit 10000 steps every day its been a really fun atmosphere around the city this weekend because we have the arts festival and pride celebrations both going on in pittsburgh right now yesterday i saw a cute girl sitting by herself and after reminding myself regret is worse than rejection i went over and started a conversation with her the chat was entertaining easy light we learned a bit about eachother and got to have a simple pleasant conversation with hundreds of people walking around the park near us this was the first time ive approached a girl to talk since my 4 year relationship ended when she and i had to head our separate ways to get to work after about 30 minutes i scribbled my number down on a piece of paper and gave it to her its been well over a day now and she hasnt contacted me and at this point im guessing probably wont but thats okay im still incredibly happy that i proved to myself i can still engage in a conversation with a stranger and have the confidence to go start a chat and handle myself throughout please dont interpret this as a silver lining sort of thing because its completely fine if we never talk again im happy about the fact i shut up all those negative worried voices and just walked up to someone and said hi thats a win for me then this afternoon i was feeling really good after my workout and had just got my new running shoes in the mail that morning so i wanted to go for a short run to try them out ive always been self conscious about my weird abb genetics mine dont line up nicely across from one another and i have some light remnants of bacne from when i was a teenager 25 now its 90 degrees full sun in the city right now so i rode that happiness i was still feeling from the previous day lathered up in sunscreen and went for my first run ever without my shirt on i ran along the water and ended up at point park and then walked home to recover through the arts festival and into the city while i was walking home some guy in a white truck was yelling hey buddy buddy buddy buddy out of his window until i turned to look at him in case i something had fallen out of my pocket or he was needing directions at which point he shouted put a shirt on and drove off i smiled so hard and ive felt amazing since then that would have destroyed me like hearing chicken legs when i was a ball boy for the soccer team at 13 but now it was the best compliment i could have gotten this jealous turd was so uncomfortable with where he is at physically that he felt the need to get my attention and try to shame me i felt wonderful i know i have my flaws but i also know i look pretty decent and it was really validating again this isnt something bad where im seeing the silver lining but a genuine sign that ive really grown and can handle that with the knowledge that i look good and im doing well it realllllllly also showed me the truth of that notion that if youve already had a success of some sort early in your day hardships later sluff off more easily i knew i already crushed chest and calves that morning and had a good run so i could take this on the cheek all in all its also been a fantastic example that happiness can compound and you can use each little nugget to fuel you on to do something else im going to keep going and try to work on getting that every day cheers,0

opening up too much hi everyone i need so advice or words of encouragement i already feel bad enough with myself i feel like i have made a mistake and potentially messed up something good i recently met this guy on tinder i have never been a fan of the app and my conversations dont usually last long with anyone but this guy and i clicked instantly we both want the same things are very similar and there seems to be a lot of chemistry where im from we are in lockdown we started talking two weeks ago and havent met yet been talking everyday pretty much all the time i had some bad things happening the last two days my dog got very sick and had to take her to emergency vets i was distraught and terrified of losing her then my parents told me theyre divorcing anyway so that plus my depression bipolar anxiety and other mental health issues i have found the last two days really rough so i opened up to this guy hes been really understanding comforting and has really been the best however i opened up about some serious stuff about my past overdosing and other things i feel like i have opened up too much i have extreme anxiety i possibly have messed this up i know we havent been talking long and it terrifies me that ill lose him because i just dumped all my shit on him i didnt mean to i was just being honest and he encouraged me to talk about it but i dont think he knew how serious itd be i told him i would talk to him tomorrow because i didnt want him to think i was doing this to make him feel bad for me or for attention i have pushed away people after opening up i guess it all was too much for them to handle he just said oh and reassured me i was being silly and it was okay but that was it i asked him if he was mad and he said no i asked if we were good and he said yes after that he just said good night and that he hoped i felt better and had a good sleep have i messed this up my anxiety is telling me so and i dont want to mess it up i regret so much opening up i knew itd be too much but he insisted and dont think he was ready to hear it all has anyone been in a similar situation thank you if youve made it this far through my post,1

new job good day i just got promoted to a brand new section at work i went from being the top producer in my division to going over to a completely new division and i started in a supervisory role im very lost i know generally about what im supposed to be doing but i feel like such a disappointment because i cant answer my employees questions every single thing i see is brand new to me and i get so stressed out because i have a limited support system of people to ask questions to everyone is working from home so i cant even have the luxury of learning a little bit by walking around and interacting with my people i like the people but a lot of them are low performers so i have to start with corrective actions before too long all the other supervisory roles are vacant so im doing work for 3 teams and my boss is new as well so i cant really go to her because she doesnt know the answer either im so stressed and every single day i get about 20 small fires i need to put out and several large fires and i have no idea how to solve any of them nobody has offered any training materials or support so i have had to find them all myself the worst part is i put in for a supervisory position in my own division but i was pulled over to this team because there were so many vacancies so i have to do admin work for a huge team start hiring processes start performance appraisals despite me only being there 2 weeks i sign off on all their work i dont know for sure if theyre doing everything right but i simply dont have the time to check everything and ask questions about everything i get escalated all of the tough things and i get all the heat when things arent going great bottom line i am so stressed out and every day after work i cry because i feel so terrible and i just sit there sad and eating unhealthy food because my energy has been sucked and my motivation is gone i had such a relaxing although boring job before and in trying to expand my horizons ive landed in a personal hell i hate every second of being alive right now and any advice would be much appreciated thanks,0

almost beat that shit advices hi to all my soldiers this is my first post on this media and i want to share you my shitty last 8 months since the start of 2021 btw of life on november 2020 ive been diagnosed with a dep because my life fucked up as a student courses were annoying af finding an internship was terribly hard i argued a lot with my friends and i lived alone in my small flat what a beautiful life i first didnt consult a specialist because i thought it was useless big mistake so i dig down more and more on february 2021 i felt terribly bad and my meds didnt help much so i went to emergencies because i wanted to die nothing was worth to stay alive i have been admitted to a psychiatry center for 1week it was cool but i fell again when i came back this time i knew i wanted to fight my family and friends were not worthy not helping at all everything in my life was flavorless but i think we dont precisely search to die we want to live in a different way the 56 following months were terrible i live in a countryside so i went to cry in a field 3 times a day i spent every single fucking day alone in my pain to feel better i decided to act on the cycle sleep nutrition exercise i messed up in all these aspects so i tried to sleep early and planned an alarm at 11am at first tried to force my body to eat at each meal and i tried to exercise a minimum walking running etc with time my body used to this and i reached a better health form this was not natural i needed to force myself every fucking days now 8 months later im still alone at home i didnt contact my school yet but i feel better i can cook i can exercise i can enjoy a book i can live by myself i even did a hike trip alone in my region during 1 week time isnt hurting anymore i still feel lonely but it is a hard problem to solve i want to share you the key points that made a difference during my recovery visit a psychiatrist please and take the meds the role of this doc isnt to help you he just asks you the right questions because you are your own doc and he wants you to do it by yourself let your phone off social media killed me a lot plus i wanted my friends to be helpful but they cant youre friends cant help you execpt if they lived this shit keep very close friends to your side maybe they cant help but they can help you to live some neutral moments instead of suffering alone in your home i didnt respect that point plan an activity to do cultural manual etc have a walk in a natural space several times a week even if it seems hard your brain need to breath fresh air buddy accept your feelings listen to your sadness and try to understand what it says keep a daily journal it helps a lot to exteriorize your feelings telling everything you think about you people life in general it helped me everyday during my hard time this is only my experience and youll probably dont relate to everything but please contact a specialist and take care of you the process is long you need to be patient but your life will be better afterwards depression is terrible its like visiting a remote dark place alone while we are thousands and hundreds people here but depression will teach you many positive things once your mind will be clear to see the world youll be very enthusiastic to enjoy just a piece of chocolate compared to others because you know how it feels to not feel pleasure at all during several months or years i give you all my support and do not forget that youre not alone and people love you they do man love you all from my french country,1

i accidentally landed into a great group of friends this year man this is a rant but im happy and i just wanna share the story so making friends as an adult can be pretty hard dont get me wrong i have friends from high school and that i grew up with but its also hard to align all our schedules to hang out or people move or you just grow distant my own roommate i barely see because we work opposite schedules but one person i kept in touch with for some reason we worked at a shitty bar when we were 18 they moved to another state but we were well acquaintanted not really even actual friends and then they moved back like 7 years later and we caught up acknowledging how odd it is that we stayed in touch and then out of anything they posted on snapchat about if anyone wanted to play among us and i joined in much to the mild chagrin of their friend group who immediately were like who the fuck is thevampirate but for a time this was how i got to know them all eventually even landing in their actual group chat this goes on for 2 months and as they also all lived in the same general area invited me to a house party i show up late to a series of goofy drunkards who all lined up and asked me guess who everyone is such a silly game for a first impression i did okay and its all been uphill since that ive gotten to know them all pretty well we go out every week to the same bar we have themed parties every month constant random outings for food or park trips deep and meaningful latenight convos so many photos its just fun a group of midlate 20somethings just living up their lives it doesnt even matter that i only showed up a few months ago or that some of them have been friends through high school or even elementary theyve basically adopted me in like ive always been there its not always perfect of course but i mean its pretty damn good this group really works and my heart and soul feel a fullness that i wasnt even aware was missing until now all through sheer coincidence more than anything funny how that works serendipity or whatever yeah i dont have a good way to end this i just wanted to share some wholesomeness thats been going on since the beginning of this year thanks for reading,0

just attended my first theatre performance in a year i cant get over how surreal it felt to actually attend a theatre performance especially since i used to frequent art performances theatre opera ballet concerts before the pandemic i missed it so much and it was so nice to get to feel this high the preperformance gathering drinks walking up to the hall getting your ticket checked settling in your seat and then the dimming of the lights the applause at the end really hit home how important culture is and the emotion it brings i cant imagine how elated the actors felt after such a long period of inactivity and finally an appreciative audience to thank them for all their hard work it was strictly regulated with only people with certificates recovery or vaccine allowed plus they checked ids to make sure the certificate was assigned to this person kudos to them for being careful while providing their services,0

ear stress while gaming lately i have noticed a grinding or vibrating sensation in or around my ears most specifically and recognizably while playing and listening to the music in video games the sensation is nonexistent or at the most significantly fainter when doing other similar activities like listening to nonvideo game music watching tv or listening to podcasts or the radio i am under a lot of stress and think its probably stress related but it really does seem specific to video games i suspect it might be something to do with game music such as that in dragon quest 11 or pokmon tending to be higher pitched and busier than the sounds of those other things i mentioned anyway thank you for reading and i am wondering if anyone has experienced something similar or has any thought about why this might be happening,1

therapy just made me more aware of how isolated i feel because most people suck at empathy ive been in therapy for years in that ive been able to identify what has made me so depressed growing up and i try to deal with it i spend a lot of time using coping methods and trying my best for a depressed person i manage to excel in life currently dealing with the sting of a breakup went on vacation to asia and ex broke nc before my trip to wish me well after what i gather was him finding out the grass isnt greener im on a dream vacation with my older sister and her child while we visit her fianc a lot of my depression is triggered from a childhood of being parentified and also unappreciated and invalidated my sister spent my formative years teasing me for liking asian culture and is now jet setting to my fantasy destination because of romantic love wasnt enough that i liked something or it meant something to me for her to care or treat me right nope only a man would make her culturally open and respect me and my interests i was livid i had been journaling using positive self talk etc but all i could think is wow people only care about me when i can offer them something creative services language skill advice emotional supportchild careif there isnt a task or skill i can do people rarely give a fuck about me i didnt want to share this and told her i needed a moment to collect myself and she kept bothering me until i cried at a shrine i told her why i was upset and she kept telling me to put it aside because were on vacation i turned on my data to call my mom she told me to pay a tour guide to take me places and hung up on me when i asked to be heard instead of throwing money at my feelings i literally just wanted someone to put themselves in my shoes for 2 seconds and be a brokenhearted 20 something who is the third wheel to a family and a newly wed couple but is trying her fucking best i didnt need to spend more money on experiences i didnt need to pretend i wasnt upset i just fucking wanted someone to walk in my very capable shoes for 30 seconds and realize the only thing i want is a little goddamn empathy my family rarely thanks me for things they dont care unless im in crisis or isolating ive learned to ask for what i need but it doesnt matter because unless i have extreme reactions they cant be bothered to hear me i am happy for my sister i truly am but jfc i am planning and helping with her wedding in the midst of a serious breakup which she also teases me about and infantilizes my heartbreak feelings dont go away because youre on vacation therapy taught me to deal with my shit but unless i act in bad old ways my family doesnt react i am more than a babysitter or a social media paparazzi im part of this family too tldr depression reared its head on exotic vacation talking through issues got me yelled at edit whoathanks for the gold didnt really expect this but if youre a depressed empathy like me i know its hard and i know its lonely trying to do good while being profoundly depressed with people and their actions well get through it,1

just because my depression started during the pandemic doesnt mean im depressed because of the pandemic im tired of everyone acting like my depression will go away when the pandemic ends as if im just a little down because of the pandemic people get depression all the time millions of people are depressed and their depression starts at all different times i would have been depressed regardless of the pandemic not every person who became depressed during the pandemic is just a little down because of the pandemic i have struggled with mental health my whole life i have diagnosed anxiety which i have had since i was very young and now i have been diagnosed with depression mental illnesses have run in my family for several generations other factors in my life have left me susceptible to depression too i do not care about going to restaurants or going to the movie theatre i see my friends at school and i still have to fake a smile around them before i go home utterly exhausted from it this isnt me just being a little sad over the pandemic because i miss my friends or going out this is me being clinically depressed do people think that people just stopped getting actual depression as soon as the pandemic started what i have isnt the same as someone else who feels a little down because they miss going to parties,1

my girlfriend has racist parents sorry if this whole this is all over the place so am a senior 16 years old and i have this girl that i am madly in love with and she is crazy in love with me aswell i met her a year ago and for me it was basically love at first sight the first week we knew each other we would stay up and facetime all night till we fell asleep and i dont even like facetime to begin with but i just couldnt get enough of her i found out probably a week or 2 after i first started liking her that her parents and the whole family dont allow their children to date poc but i just didnt care because i was so in love with her and wanted her to be with me so i kept pursuing her and eventually got her to fall in love with me we were just friends with benefits just kissing and cuddling and kept it a secret from our friends at first but eventually ended up telling them but when we go out in public or where theres people she wont even hold my hand or even hug me im a huge physical touch person if people could see it happening and i know she was paranoid of her parents finding out but i just feel like she is embarrassed to be seen with me in a bfgf type of way like we were at an amusement park an hour and a half away from our house and i rarely even could get a hug from her or hold her hand without her walking ahead she isnt allowed over to my house anymore maybe because she get home late by just a few mins every time but the only time i can see her and be able to hug her or anything is when our friend group hangs out because shes too scared or embarrassed i think to hug in at school where people can see it just sucks that the person im in love with and is in love back with me i cant even see whenever she has tried twice telling her parents that she likes me which they didnt allow because i am black but everytime she gets in trouble for it and almost got her car and phone taken aswell just because of that they are obsessed with our friend who is part hispanic but they dont care about the fact that hes part hispanic because he is mainly white i just feel like shit because i have to be judged for my skin color which is something that i cant even choose but that automatically makes me a bad person to them i had a good first impression on her parents i had even offered to help them clean up when she had us over but obviously that did nothing but i just dont know what im supposed to do because she wants me to wait until she is 18 because she thinks that she can convince her parents that dating a black person isnt wrong but what doesnt make sense to me is why they would allow it in a few months rather than just now and everytime i ask her how she will change them she doesnt give me an answer she just tells me to wait until she turns 18 and i dont know if i should or not because my other friend who has similar parents said that they wouldnt hang pictures of their grandkids up just because they were mixed i dont want my children to have to be judged like that i wish this upon no one the way you can be with someone you love because of your skin color its a horrible feeling i just want to talk to her parents and try and convince them that there would be nothing wrong with being with me but she wont let me talk to them and ive been trying to for almost a year now i just dont know what im supposed to do i dont know if i should wait or not because im not convinced at all that she can change her parents and she wont give me a way that she can so i have no reason to believe in her i want to but i cant when she has nothing i started hating the fact that i was born this way for a while but got over this i just think about how different things could have been if i were just born white everything would be so much easier i just need advice on whether or not i should stay with her or not we arent dating but we are just friends with benefits i guess it just sucks please help me i dont know whether its worth the risk of waiting around for something that seems like 0 change of working or just trying to get over her and see if someone else has interest in me that doesnt have racist parents sorry for how long this is but thank you to everyone that helps,1

i need some advice for being a better bf for my gf who is going through a lot of mental health problems right now i have been with this girl for 4 months and we are both the age of 20 in college our relationship has been amazing before the past couple of weeks i am really close to losing her because i am just not good at being emotional support for her since school started in february she works part time 25 hours a week while taking 19 credits as a stem major and contributes to a sorority she has no time for anything and has just been so overwhelmed she gets about 4 hours of sleep a night and is falling behind in her classes every night she has panic attacks and is just so insanely stressed and a lot of the times she says she cant do life and says she is going to kill herself our relationship is semilong distance i am able to visit her every other week and be able to spend time with her for 6 days i feel i am a lot better at being emotional support for her in person rather than over text or over the phone she tells me that i am making it harder for her mentally because i am just really bad at talking her through it she also says that i give her more stress because when i talk to her i make her feel bad that she is behind in her classes our relationship is on thin ice and she keeps telling me that we are not going to make it i potentially have covid so i will not be able to see her for a while i am just looking for some advice on how to talk to her i am in love with this girl and i just always see past the mentally hurt girl when she is mentally healthy she is just the sweetest funniest appreciative and loving girl we have a lot of potential in our future and i really dont want to lose that does anyone have some good advice or links for how to talk to someone who is insanely stressed and depressed,1
paying close attention to your morning coffee can help you start your day with happiness were told that if we want to be happy we need to exist in the present moment but what does that actually mean one helpful way to think about it is living through your senses what you can perceive right now as humans we have many senses a lot more than five and we can use these to pull us back from worries about the future and regrets from the past take drinking a cup of tea or coffee as an example we can listen to the kettle boiling look at the colour if the drink and the mug that its in youve probably seen it 1000 times but you can look at it with beginners mind as if youve never seen it before feeling the warmth of the cup in your hands smelling the tea before you drink it noticing the taste flavour feeling it pass down our throat there are many more perceptions for us to focus on by tuning in to these we ground ourselves in the present moment we calm ourselves and we can draw happiness from our everyday lives applying this awareness to your morning tea or coffee is an easy way to start to integrate awareness of the here and now into your life listen on apple podcasts listen on google podcasts listen on spotify other ways to listen,0

question do you ever get a random thought about not being depressed for a while and are suddenly depressed,1
never been so stressed in my life im usually really good at handling stress i brush shit off for my own sanity perhaps sometimes a little too much this time however is different my wife and i are self employed and we are planning on buying a house for the first time in a few weeks im incredibly stressed because its very difficult to get preapproved when youre self employed especially in my situation the long and short of it is i need to get preapproved and buy this house for the sake of my finances otherwise i might end up broke in some shithole apartment in the next few months until next year my wife handles financial stress very poorly as a result she mostly asks to stay out of the loop on finances i dont have a lot of people to talk about it with right now im taking a hard look at everything and as a grown ass man im about to break down and cry from how stressful this all is god help me,1
im feeling bad physically and mentally i guess not being able to board my plane took a toll on my health covid is a disaster,1
anyone else they live in a family that acutely stresses them out daily with the exception of my father my family are good people but still stress me out were all adults and im the youngest of them some examples but not limited to older brother jumps into conversations and often says something that irritates me a snarky comment or tone can be pushy mother is often sarcastic in a bad way if i dont understand something often throws assumptions oh i guess you just dont care about x can also be pushy father the worst stresser and worst person ive ever known impatient very pushy disrespectful violent towards family and animals easily irritated unpredictable honestly his presence just puts a lot of weight on my shoulders because i feel like i have to take his shit otherwise he will take his anger on someone else if i walk away which will just make things much worse such as a fight so i often have to have a different persona around him i think the only exception is my sister it seems shes more simple and calm when compared to the rest of the 3 even at times where im suppose to relax i cant 100 just temporarily forget my worries its hard to find a place to be alone both at home and outside even under a tree im afraid something will happen at home and i wont be there to stop it or ill receive a terrible phone call mostly because of my father escelating situations add those things along with worrying about health problems such as my hearing and tinnitus i look forward to the day where i am in complete control of my life if i ever have a family it will only happen if i know for sure that i know me and my wife will be good to each other and others otherwise i look forward to the day where im free of my current uncontrollable stresses where i can wake up one morning feed the animals and relax outside a time in my life where i can control on solving my stressors oh well it could be a lot worse but it could be better in the future,1
i wont be seeing my loved ones again yet i cant take the time to show them how much i really care about themmaybe i dont like maybe im actually just as much of a shitty person as this illness has diluted me into believing maybe the sickness is just unveiling the truth of who i really amthe truth never leavesits funny it just keeps getting better i wont fight it and in any case its all destined for nothing anyway itll be over soon,1
school stresses me out so much i dont understand how im expected to take and do really well on all these tests to get into college the sats are stressing me out so much because i have to get my score up especially my math score and i have no time to study and the sat is in two weekends i come home with hours and hours of homework and i dont get it done till the time i go to bed i still have to take the act and im delayed on that because im so fucking busy in may i have 3 ap exams just so i can get college credits on top of all this i have to keep my grades up but i havent been doing well this marking period because im so fucking stressed i dont understand why people dont see the issue with this school collegeboard or whatever do not help and overlook the stress that me and my school mates face everyday and how we never have time to do shit and lead a healthy lifestyle,1
how to get out of the loop of selfhate i really did not realize i had this problem until about 6 months ago i do not like myself i do not see myself as worthy of anyones attention i have always had lots of friends and surrounded by people as much as i want to be but i cannot shake this voice in my head if people invite me out i tell myself its because they want me to drive they want to crash at my place after they want to use my pool they do nothing to give me this feeling yet my mind tries to convince me i am 24 and never been in a relationship every time a girl has shown interest in me i turn them away they sleepover and i dont make a move then they ask why i didnt and i do not have an answer in my head of course i do not feel good enough to make a move i fear rejection even though i know i wouldnt be rejected i have turned down probably 1015 girls in the past two years alone it makes me feel dumb i sit here lonely yet reject everyone that comes my way it is selfsabotage how can i ever progress when this voice convinces me otherwise i went to a club recently and had to leave i looked around at everyone having a good time and happy and i was standing there feeling like an ogre in a mix with all king and queens i just do not understand how people have confidence i do not understand why i never had any can anyone relate with the voice in their head just convincing them to think negativity 100 of the time,1
countless places to see billions of people to meet and yet im trapped funny how theres literally countless things you could do and wondrous places to see around the globe and yet not only are you restricted by physical means and personal limits but also the inescapable prison that is your own mind so many goddamn things you need to have and need to be just so that you could experience a fraction of what you think will make you happy its just exhausting to think about,1

overcoming housefire trauma there was a neighborhood housefire a few months ago in my area and our house was a few feet away from getting burned down ever since i get hyper alert whenever someone shouts or raises hisher voice because i get reminded of that day i also palpitate whenever i hear an ambulance or a firetruck my main problem is even if months have already passed im still greatly stressed out by it i always have thoughts that maybe a fire will happen again especially at night which will be worse to add after that neighborhood fire there were two more minor fire incidents that happened nearby last night i went to bed early there was no trigger but all of a sudden my thoughts were racing there might be a fire kept on repeating in my head a neighbor started coughing the house is close to each other and i began to palpitate and get scared as if im waiting for something i really dont know how do i get over this or where do i start on addressing it i hate feeling like this even more so that i feel im the only one who got affected this much i really hope someone will reply here i really need the help thank you,1
self confidence and self worth are not the same a lot of people seem genuinely surprised that i suffer from depression because i like to joke around and im extremely confident in myself what a lot of people dont get is i can be confident in my abilities while still feeling worthless im very intelligent athletic and charming despite my obvious cockiness lol my problem isnt that i feel i lack those things its that i always feel like if im not the best im a failure if its for a job application im sure im qualified but someone better qualified definitely applied so why bother im very muscular and reasonably good looking but the girls i date are definitely used to dating sex gods so im constantly fighting those shadows when it comes to sports i know im decent but i gotta be the best so anything less than 1st hurts hell depending on the competition even 1st place feels empty it sucks that peoples go to advice is be confident in yourself for people lacking confidence thats way underestimating the task for people who are depressed but dont experience a lack of confidence its worthless advice,1

in 2009 i helped hurricane katrina victims hurricane ida is hard for me in 2009 i was a chemical engineering intern outside of new orleans louisiana i lived in jefferson parish and worked in hahnville louisiana outside bayou boute it was 4 years after hurricane katrina sisters of charity hospital the hospital for the poor before katrina was still closed on my weeknights i volunteered at a makeshift medical clinic operating out of a church basement and staffed by medical students residents and interns from nearby tulane university i spent my weekends building homes for habitat for humanity in the 9th ward the neighborhood hit hardest by hurricane katrina many homes still had blue tarps where the roof blew off whole streets were still full of empty and destroyed homes the neighborhood looked like pictures of bombed out neighborhoods i had seen in world war 2 documentaries fema had spray painted these homes with the number of dead bodies found inside grass grew up through the street and sidewalk lawns were littered with ruined possessions and cars the owners had either died or left and never returned we did the best we could to help we built houses on stilts higher than katrinas storm surge i looked into the faces of universityeducated people like school teachers and accountants who had been made homeless overnight it was heartbreaking we promised these people that it was going to be ok we gave them shelter we told them the worst period of their life was behind them my heart is breaking again due to hurricane ida it is different when the faces on television were your neighbors and people who touched your life they changed me for the better i am upset and disgusted that my former neighbors in new orleans have had to face two devasting hurricanes in their lifetimes i wish i could go down and help again but i am not in a position to do so my neighborhood in jefferson parish was one of the hardest hit with 10 to 15 feet of water in the street an electrical transmission tower near my old apartment collapsed and fell into the mississippi river more than 1 million customers are without electricity hospitals have been damaged and are running on backup generators hurricane ida made landfall too fast for the new orleans to evacuate people who do not have cars doctors nurses first responders and the national guard in louisiana and neighboring states are exhausted because louisiana texas alabama oklahoma mississippi georgia florida and arkansas are dealing with a devasting 4th wave of covid19 the postkatrina plan had been to evacuate hospital patients out of louisiana to surrounding states but covid19 meant that the hospitals in neighboring states were full of covid19 patients after katrina first responders and national guard from neighboring states handled the majority of the rescues and emergency response because louisiana first responders and national guardsmen had been hurt lost their homes been killed injured or had family members killed or injured those resources are not available today national guard units and first responders in neighboring states were already overburdened due to covid19 our public safety infrastructure is close to breaking down,1

i cant stand my family and their dysfunction i have been suffering from the flulike symptoms for half a decade now from throat tightening nasal drips muscle soreness cold and general depression and now that im stuck inside the house with my family i cant help but feel helpless my dad blows a fuse for the smallest things completely negative judgmental over everyone thats why we dont have family or visitors come over the house no one likes him for his personality ges just far better off thats why people kiss his ass what i hate the most is that they dont have a sense of boundaries not being able to have control and say about my personal items when he gets unreasonable really upsets me for example he fucking threw my plants away because he saw news about an increase of dengue cases cant i have anything thats mine hes needy and requires special treatment from everyone its such a drain to be around his negativity and his overall personality he takes food from my plate even there is literally whole untouched piece right in front of him he took my food that i paid for without permission even though were not in speaking terms its not that im tight wad and selfish but the fact that he gets to take my stuff and do as he pleases is the problem whats worse is that this learned behavior is exactly what my asshole of a brother does as well i get anxious just being near or around him yesterday i hit my head bad and it started to bleed as i hurried and went into a frantic pace trying to leave the kitchen as soon as he opened his mouth and started talking to me about how to live my fucking life were not even in speaking terms my mom even left the country to get away from this asshole theyre not divorced or anything but shes making a sacrifice for us to get japanese citizenship started investing there no wonder my mom had the foresight to offer me to leave the country and this horrible family,1

i no longer believe in the myth that any challenge can be overcome with hard work alone i used to believe that if someone tried hard enough they could do anything i no longer believe that i think hard work wit the help of others and luck can allow someone to succeed in their endeavors but not hard work alone this was quite a blow to me im trying to replace this myth with something else at the moment,1
millions of years of evolution among millions of species on this planet all with a single common instinct within them survive and here my brain is telling me everyday to kill myself if that doesnt prove that depression is one of the biggest illness to ever plague us then i dont know what will i really hope one day people would emphathise and know how it feels to live this way and how hard it is to open up and how small it feels to beg for a way out only to be ignored or shut down that too by people whom you would give your life for fuck this shit i hope i was born heartless and emotionless so i didnt care about these kind of people but i still love them even after they refused to help me i hope i die a miserable death it would only be fitting to the already cruel game someone is playing with me if i cower and fail to kill myself and live long enough to maybe make something of myself i promise to do everything in my power to eradicate or atleast help the people suffering from this,1

anyone keep switching from admitting to yourself that you have depression to invalidating yourself into thinking you were just playing victim i know i have issues but i go through manic mood swings and while on the depressive end i feel like absolute shit when im out of that phase and feel somewhat normal again i tell myself i greatly exaggerated the effect in my mind it doesnt help that my self loathing wont let me admit that i have depression because i keep thinking i dont deserve to be depressed so i invalidate myself and continue life until the next phase hits and the cycle continues,1
staying stressed im so stressed more than normal im still in the grieving process since july 2019 when my papaw died he was like my dad now fast fwd to now my grandma is selling her house because her dr stated she doesnt need to be living by herself i cant live with her because i have my own family and my apt is not big enough for her and she wouldnt be able to handle my kids all the time plus shes starting to get frail my grandma is super strong and looks 20 years younger than her age of 75 so shes going to live with my aunt in iowa and shes all i got my sister barely talks to me because of other choices and my medical condition epilepsy so i dont get to see my niece and nephew very often i dont speak to my mother stepfather if you want to call him that and my brother for other personal reasons so i feel like im being left alone even though i have my 3 kids and fiance i see her everyday and talk to her everyday my kids get dropped off there after school and we go see her i feel like im just losing her like i did papaw and then when she passes im going to lose her again im extremely sad yes im depressive and on medication but medication cant help block all emotions that are happening in short periods of time i cant talk to a therapist face to face because they wont be back in the office till july and i cant talk to them through zoom or on the phone because i need someone there to call me out when i try to hold things back plus before this i constantly stay stressed and my anxiety meds just put me to sleep i dont want to be this stressed out all the time just needed to talk,1
i ruined my friendship with my bestfriend and i dont want to live anymore first of all im sorry if this is wrong subreddit to talk about if it is i will delete it im not sure where else to put this few months ago i started to have unusual anxieties out of blue i dont get usually anxieties but i did it started at night and i remember that it was specifically about me dying soon later on itd be different things and soon i would have constantly anxieties during days or me just doing whatever later on i would focus too much on little details the way my pfp is the way people talk to me and etc but i focused a lot on how my bff behaved and talked to me she is really important person in my life like i have been friends with her since 2015 or 2016 she is everything to me so i started to get anxious and think that she is ignoring me now talking less to me for whatever reason or liking me less we had lots of fight because of that she was dealing with problems too but i will not talk about them its not my place anyway it got to the point where we fought nearly everyday it even got to the point where i guilt tripped her not on purpose of course when she told me that i was freaking out badly i wanted to kill myself even before we fought was driving me nuts and there was a moment when i planned when to kill myself i cant swim and im afraid of pain there was a bridge not far away from where i lived i had a specific day like i think it was on saturday night not many cars drive or people walk at night so it was perfect time for me jump off the bridge eventually i told her my plan and she begged me not to do it which i didnt when she told me for the first time that i guilt tripped her i felt shit it was that day when i left the server and thought i could finally end myself i hurt a person that meant so much to me and now i have hurt her the only person that i was supposed to help and be there for her i couldnt kill myself all i did was just stand on the bridge and stare at the ocean so i left the place back to my own place and decided to fix myself unfortunately im a piece of shit and didnt fix anything we fought again and a lot i guilt tripped her more at one point i thought i fell in love her and maybe thats how i have been i was extremely jealous of one guy talking to her so i really hated him and i started to hate everything that was related to her bf i learned that i wasnt in love with her but i was being extremely selfish i wanted to be her only reason for her to be happy and not other people i wanted to be her number one no matter what because thats how i viewed her but eventually things did get better to some extent we did fight less or maybe even not that much but it became more of her being afraid of telling me just not to start another fight but i was getting better and i didnt go apeshit over her mentioning her bf i was quite fine about it things to me seemed better getting less anxious we even called this monday we had fun we didnt fight this week at all but now today she told me she doesnt want to be my bestfriend it didnt help that i was having a mental breakdown before she told me that i would never think i would hear that we have been friends for so long we went through stuff together i have been there for her and she has been there for me she never had an easy life and i have been there for her for everything that was possible i loved her so much i cant believe this happened at all i dont have a meaning anymore she was everything to me the only bestfriend that i could count on i never told my feelings to anyone than her but now that she doesnt want to be my bestfriend i have lost everything it may sound very stupid for you guys but i mean it when i say that she was everything for me she brought me happiness just by messaging me she doesnt think in the future things will be the same or that we will be bestfriends again i have ruined everything i hurt the only peron who i deeply cared i hurt them to the point where they are afraid of me at times i was always afraid of being alone but had high hopes because she was with me i thought that was going to last no matter what i wasnt myself this summer i put my anger onto her and this is my consequence now i dont have anybody in my life i feared to be alone and now i am alone no one i dont care what happens to me anymore im fine if i go blind by this point i am having big eye issues and that made my anxiety go apeshit my anxiety isnt the reason why i acted like this i should have controlled myself better and not hurt her but i was a dumb shit im still a dumb shit now im no one no one to have im all alone and i deserve all the pain im having i dont care who i am anymore i really dont care if im alive anymore the pain is too big now i dont think i can handle it now i made plans for next week to end myself,1
my therapist cried in a session and another therapist told me to quit her asap i have been seeing my therapist for a few years but just started recently feeling comfortable enough to open up about my past trauma to her upon doing so she cried she did try to hold it back but eventually she cried then immediately apologized and told me that i remind her of her daughter and she cares about me it honestly was the first time ive felt love from a parental figure however during that time i was actually having a mental breakdown i was reliving my trauma everyday and it impacted my work greatly my boss was not understanding and my physichiatrist eventually recommended a extensive therapy group with a great therapist this therapist was not at all what i expected she was incredibly into the tough love approach she made everyone go in a circle and talk about their most traumatic moments i have social anxiety and these were strangers so i did not really participate in that but i did talk about my therapy experience and my coping mechanisms and such she eventually found out that my therapist cried once in a session she told me that was beyond unprofessional and that i should drop her immediately i actually did end up dropping her only to get a horrible experience with another therapist one recommended by the therapist that told me to drop my initial therapist i was so sad and eventually went back to my initial therapist i havent seen anything wrong but i cant get help but feel insecure about my own decision am i making the right choice is it okay to go to someone cause they feel like a friend you can open up to are emotions bad and unprofessional for a therapist to express lil update wow thank you all so much for the comments and awards it was so nice to read all of your experiences im so overwhelmed with happiness rn to not feel so alone i have seen 8 therapists in my life and i have never felt this comfortable with one it honestly was the first time i havent regretted telling a professional my personal trauma although not everyone agrees with this approach her emotion ultimately showed me that i have people that care about me and it really helped me in a time when i really just needed compassion with that being said i am continuing to see my empathetic therapist as that is what works best for me thank you again for all of your reassurance and encouragement in helping me choose whats best for me i struggle a lot with decision making so i was really in my head about this anywho just wanted to say you are part of a wonderful community here and i hope you all find happinesspeace im not there quite yet but baby steps are okay,1

sometimes the people around you dont care about you fuck them i want to be honest with all of you people dont care about your well being its a hard pill to swallow but thats the truth i remember being in the darkest days of my life dreading every living moment never going out eating and rarely even slept my mind telling me noone cares about me or wanting someone to reach out to see if i was ok sadly it doesnt work the way you think people are always busy in their own problems and thoughts so you never come up in their mind i was suicidal for weeks wanting to end my life until i realized that i dont need self validation or love from other people that doesnt mean you should be cold hearted and give the finger to everyone you meet just live your life the way you want it dont worry about the people that dont give a shit about you focus on your well being before anyone else tldr not everyone around you gives a fuck about you so fuck them,1

my best friend is severely depressed and quit her meds cold turkey and isnt acting like herself tw i dont know how to help her we have been best friends for years we even loved together as roommates for quite a few she has struggled with depression basically her whole life i have always been a support system for her and i thought i had seen her bad episodes i knew her when she almost made an attempt but i have never seen anything like this unfortunately we dont live together any more but i try to visit or talk on the phone as much as possible and she changed she is still honest to me about her symptoms for the most part which i appreciate as it makes it easier for me to help her but i dont know what to she has been suicidal the past three months isolating her self from friends and family only talking to me because i make her and that was hard to do she hasnt been eating and has been nearly fainting at work as a result she has no regard for future consequences she was fine with the potential of going to jail she is not keeping up with basic life necessities and is completely reliant on her boyfriend to survive its not an abusives relationship he really cares about her but i believe they may be codependent she stated that her dissociation and suicidal thoughts have gotten worse so she decided to quit her meds last week she was on a very high dose and was on this led for over a year not something you can just quit without talking to a doctor when she was really down i sent her the numbers to some local crisis lines and she got mad at me saying she cant afford to be hospitalized i told her they are just numbers to talk and are free they cant hospitalize you but she didnt want to hear it i dont know what do in the last bad period a few years ago where she almost attempted i was able to get her to go to therapy and it was really helping for a while but now she is isolating herself from even her therapist i am absolutely terrified that i am going to get a call that i was too late and that she is gone is there anything i can do,1
how do i stop overthinking overthinking has been a problem of mine for a long time i have restless nights since i can remember i dont have any problems with the past or letting go as for letting go somehow was always easy for me but i constantly overthink every little detail of my life and everything that could happen and i can never really live in the moment my thoughts affect my emotions and my emotions affect my thoughts its like a never ending vicious circle i also noticed that my overthinking starts to affect my relationship negatively sidenote i tried lsd not too long ago because i heard about experiences that helped people with overthinking andor depression and for me lsd worked wonders for about the next 3 weeks i really enjoyed life and i was living in the moment it felt like someone tidied up my thoughts everything became clear my thoughts didnt stop 100 but the little overthinking that i had left seemed so irrational that i could just dismiss it as beautiful as it was i dont want to revoke to taking lsd every time my overthinking begins i always thought overthinking is something that will always stick with me and there is nothing i can to about it but since i tried lsd and stopped overthinking for a while i noticed how beautiful life can be as long as my thoughts dont disrupt me from enjoying life to the fullest and now i really want to achieve that mindset again,1
lonely i dropped out of school earlier this year went to college and dropped out of that too i cant cope with anything always feel lonely and depressed i spend 24 hours a day in my dark room give up at this point,1
i know my depression would be much better than it is if i actually had even the smallest amoubt of support im someone who has helped people my whole life and been generous and a great friend but even so i am all alone i just know that if someone even just checked on me once or twice a year or helped me with even just dishes when im super depressed it would give me so much fuel not saying it would fix everything but part my depression tells me i am alone and no one cares and i dont have much to combat those words with because well here i am just rambling but i really believe that,1
talk to someone about your problems they said itll help they said i told my mom about my problems thankfully she was very accepting but thats about the only good thing that came of it she didnt understand how bad its gotten she doesnt understand that i want to be alone she doesnt understand that i need more help than just im here for you its really hard for me to talk about this to my parents so i cant tell them that i feel like i need professional help now its also really awkward for me to talk to them since its very obvious that theyre subtly trying to support me i appreciate the effort but i wish they just acted like they did before i cant stop thinking about the fact that i might have just ruined everything theres also something that bothers me about my parents knowing im fine with my closest friend knowing but i cant shake the feeling that it was a big mistake to tell my parents,1

ive given up since childhood ive never felt truly happy i thought i found it once and i ruined it it destroyed me and i let myself slip into darkness i was numb uncaring and selfish i turned to drugs to cope i didnt want to die but i didnt want to live i was stuck in an emotionless twilight at the time i didnt mind it because i didnt hurt anymore a few years back i got a new job and met someone there that i instantly fell in love with it scared me i tried to keep my keep my distance i knew i would ruin it eventually i thought it best to not drag anyone down with me that was easier said than done the more we talked the more i realized she understands the type of pain im going through i let myself care about her we finally expressed how we feel about each other and began dating we both had our problems and knew what we were getting in to at least i thought so i struggled to overcome my addiction and learn to love again i was honestly a really shitty partner in the beginning i didnt communicate well i was absent and distant she stuck it through with me and i became a much better person i owe it all to her she was an alcoholic and when covid began she quit her retail job and spiraled out of control it was a struggle i worked 1012 hour days 6 days a week i would come home to her blacked out almost daily i stuck with it doing whatever i could to help her overcome she ended up in the hospital a few times and eventually tried an outpatient treatment program it didnt help after reaching out to her mother for advice she suggested inpatient i was desperate to help her so i agreed i didnt want her to be locked away like that but i didnt know what else to do id tried everything up that point her mom gave her an ultimatum go to inpatient willing or have it court ordered she went on her own it didnt help she came back even worse disturbed by all the horrifying stories she had to listen to while in there from other addicts she resented me for colluding with her mom one day i come home from work and she wasnt home that immediately struck me as odd and i tried to call and text her to no reply her phone was turned off there was no note her things and car were still there but she had disappeared i began searching her known hangout spots around a nearby river nothing i was getting scared i called her mom and she hadnt heard from her we called the police and filed a missing persons report they pinged her phone and its last location was miles away sheriffs checked it out and nothing the next day her mom tells me she heard from her i was so happy to know she was alright then she told me she was with her abusive ex i felt my heart shatter even still i tried to get a hold of her to understand what happened she regretted her decision and explained she acted on a drunken impulse she wanted to come home i was upset but i understood addiction can make you do terrible things i forgave her and went to get her a couple weeks later she did it again i was angry despite that i reached out to her to make sure she was alright i wanted to know if this is what she truly wanted and if not i was willing to bring her home again she eventually asked me to come get her once we got home i explained that this is going to take time to heal from i still want us to be together but im very hurt she apologized and eventually i was able to forgive her lately shes been so angry and resentful towards me for my behavior in the beginning of our relationship she keeps bringing up past mistakes things weve already talked about things ive accepted responsibility for and sincerely apologized it doesnt seem to matter its like she hates me now she expects her past to be accepted forgiven and forgotten my mistakes however are continuous sources of anger for her and they can never be forgiven i opened up to her recently and told her that im not well i tried to explain that i have been planning on ending my life soon she didnt listen and started getting upset about my past again its like she wants me to do it i told her that this isnt just a plea for attention or to feel sorry for me that im serious and im making one last attempt to get help she blew me off and began interrogating me about something in my past at this point my heart has grown cold im numb again i dont feel that i deserve to be happy that im incapable of being loved i think its time to follow through i dont want to hurt anyone anymore one last selfish act the last time ill ever hurt anyone ever again,1
im going to a mental hospital and now i feel like im not depressed enough i feel unmotivated lonely and like i dont have a goal in life massive guilt has been pushing me down for two years now ive thought about harming and killing myself multiple times but lately since i know im getting hospitalized i feel like i dont deserve to go there ive never actually harmed myself or attemted suicide and i feel like im taking away a spot in that hospital from someone whos problems are way worse i definately know that i have thoughts from time to time which are extremely bad and sometimes make me suicidal but they always go away at some point its so hard for me to know if im depressed i always feel like i cant say im depressed because there are probably others who feel way worse and would laugh at my problems,1

how i learnt how to love myself at the age of 15 i am not the problem i am strong and constantly growing as a person hi i am a 15 year old teenager who became introspective and selfaware about himself i am from a very unstable family when i was in 7th grade i had suicidal thoughts feelings that my problems would go on and on and will not stop hated myself but then i realized i had an ambition i always thought of saving somebody from suicide and changing the lives of others i always wanted to become a psychotherapist and write philosophical stuff theories on my personal diary of thoughts which i hide when i was in 7th8th grade i was kind of a people pleaser too nave tried to see the good in all repressed my anger in order to avoid conflicts didnt know when things are going too far but then in 9th grade i realized that boundaries must be created my parents are not really good parents my mom is emotionally unstable very bossy sometimes gets mad randomly while my dad constantly invalidates my feelings and gaslights me i cannot get in therapy they think its useless both of them constantly fights there is no more understanding agreement between them my mom is very manipulative towards my dad threatens to leave us if she didnt get what she want then my dad would get scared and follow anyways convinced them to get to family therapy didnt work they think its a waste of time they never really understood that relationships could recover beautifully even if i told them that i told my dad the repressed anger and sadness i have been keeping for years ended up getting told to just accept it got invalidated i know that my parents are not perfect in raising me nobody is perfect someday in the future i will heal myself from this trauma and now i just have to endure that i am from a very dysfunctional family i usually just vent to my best friends or online i really want to move out and go to a university currently in grade 10 only 2 more years cant really make new friends or go out due to the pandemic its very strict here so i just have to message or video call my previous friends that i trust i know that this will probably follow me through my adulthood due to the fact that i never really felt loved so i daydream every night about finding someone who would accept me for who i am understand me help me grow and mature as a person but then i realized i have myself i know that i am an amazing and a lovable person who deserves to be loved people have told me i am soft hearted open minded a great listener never invalidates intelligent and not a judgmental person i confirmed what they said because i finally know my mindset after allowing time for myself this is how i learnt how to love and know myself i identified the positive things about me in which i truly believe in regardless of what some people say i am soft hearted and kind because of my ambitions on becoming a psychotherapist helping people heal themselves save people i know i cant save every person help the world but saving one would mean the world to them i know i am a great listener and open minded because i would often listen with an open mind and an open heart i dont invalidate because i believe that the person that can know you the most is yourself you shouldnt just brush it off tell that there are many other problems i empathize i know i am not judgmental because i have this mindset where i view people like a spectrum between bad and good i believe everyone has flaws and it is up to us if we are going to accept them or not depending on the severity of their traits i know that every behavior has a reason so i should be open and know from their perspective sometimes people deserve to be forgiven but i usually dont talk to them afterwards but remove grudges 2nd i identified the negative traits about me and determined if i should improve it or accept it i know i am a person who can take a lot of personal stuff from people very giving too kind and nave but now i know that i have attracted a lot of toxic people i focused more on myself and decided to cut them all out and keep the ones who i feel like i can trust and are decent and genuinely wants me to be happy and okay i learnt that its better to have a few close friends than to have a lot of friends started realizing when i was in 8th grade improvement another thing i daydream a lot i can sometimes be very unaware of my surroundings which annoys my parents but i accept that it gives me insights about life makes me know more things deeply gives me encouragement and hope acceptance thats all i know for a fact this will follow me from adulthood but it would be my responsibility to heal myself i know that i have myself me and my friends may someday stop reconnecting but i know that i have and i love myself someday i hope to find the one who will love me help me for more improvement idk if i would forgive my parents because i realized that parents are not perfect in raising a child i just have to focus on endurance acceptance and maturity for 2 more years,0
i need your opinion please so my severely depressed ex boyfriend broke up with me some days ago he was distancing for two months now i tried everything i could but it reached its peek and he told me he needs to let me move on he will not get better and i deserve someone who can give me the world it was all really respectful and caring on the one hand he tells me he needs someone he can see and have things in common on the other hand he says he doesnt need anybody or anyone anymore he just wants to be alone completely he barely even talks to family but he says they know what his problems are and its his fight he says he doesnt feel anything anymore he doesnt know who or what he is its like he lost himself he said the guy i knew and fell in love with is gone and dead and he had to get rid of him to get stronger and better does anyone know why or what could have happened all got really bad two weeks ago when something happened related to his dad who died surprisingly without anyone knowing he couldnt say goodbye and he was his best friend from then on he only wanted to be alone and i let him but now he broke up and said we will never be together and its not our choice to make he is also suicidal cant talk about whats going on and also has adhd and autism spectrum disorder i could tell he was always kinda depressed from time to time and that he is struggling with low self esteem and hate for himself he was slowly drifting away he used to be so in love with me wanted to make things work and was kind and lovely and then he distanced said he is at a dark place and from then it went downhill he shut me out and kept on pushing me away and even broke up over text because he cant talk i know this is probably the end he said he wont message me again even though he reached out to me to ask if i am okay after the break up is this not only depression but also some kind of trauma why destroy the person you were and decide to kill the love too that we had i can tell it bothers him when i bring the good old times up he keeps saying i should stop bringing things up what happened to him this cant be just depression right i know it wont change anything but i have to get this off my chest he wants me to forget him and move on but it was important to him to let me know nothing of this is my fault and i didnt do anything wrong its all on him please help me to understand i need closure,1

should i stay please someone help me im so conflicted ive 21f been with my boyfriend 27m for about a year now weve been living together for several months and have become codependent ive noticed that he has some angeremotional issues and they have been greatly affecting me there are times where he drives recklessly yells gets angry at the dogs slams things or generally expresses his anger outwardly hes scared me on multiple occasions yet he is simultaneously my only source of emotional support i was in denial about it for a long time and didnt tell anyone not even my therapist out of fear that they would make me break up with him or tell me to leave he apologized for his behavior and has committed to going to therapy but im not sure if its smart to get back into the relationship as it takes time to healchange each person ive talked to has given contradicting advice although most voted to have a clean breakup many have pointed out the red flags and its making me second guess a lot of the relationship was it manipulation was i stuck in a submissive role i think its a mix of a lot of different things or am i still in denial about how toxic it was my logic is that if he could control it he would have stopped meaning he needs time to work on it thus it would be illogical to jump back into a relationship without giving him enough time to work on himself in therapy my therapist recommended taking some time apart although that can translate into many different things distance a break a breakup etc weve spent the past couple of weeks apart on weird talking terms and i just want to figure out what i should do ive never been more confused hurt and alone in my entire life i dont know what to believe anymore i guess im just trying to figure out if i should still try and make it work all advice is greatly appreciated and im more than happy to answer any questions since this is a relatively short post thank you for listening sending my love to whoever is reading,1
can anxietystress cause these types of memory issues i am getting confused during the daylike today for instance i was in the bath and couldnt remember which faucet handle was coldhot i got it wrong and tested all the other faucets in my house getting it wrong i also checked my weight on those manual scales which i use a lot and the notch bit that you use to determine whether to move the slider down or up was down and i forgot if i had to move the slider up or down i also was watching family feud and the question of what is something your mother let you do that your wife wont and i kept confusing it with something your mom didnt let you do that your wife does does that seem worrisome for dementia,1

i shouldnt have to lie about my depression to get a sick day but i do every time because saying i threw up everywhere last night gets you a oh sweetie take the day off to rest its okay but saying my depression is acting up really badly and i just cant do it today gets you a dont be lazy everyone gets sad suck it up and come into work i shouldnt have to be fucking ashamed of my depression its as medical as the flu yet people seem to think mental illnesses arent a valid reason and that youre not really sick fuck that shit we need to break the stigma towards mental illnesses in general,1

how to explain that while being stressed isnt causing major issues yet i know it will eventually i have been burnt out for months now i go through cycles that start with being stressed and overwhelmed and end with me feeling suicidal and exhibiting a lot of depression symptoms back in september i felt like the cycle was starting up again and tried to be proactive and get help from a counsellortherapist since then i have seen 3 different people at 2 different places and nobody took me seriously i kept my request pretty simple i want to find sress management techniques that dont involve mindfulness or meditation or anything like that i have practised mindfullness and meditation for nearly a decade and the results were extremely negative i figured that cant be the only way to manage stress but it seems like everywhere i look it all says mindfulness my last appointment i tested in the green for streds despite feeling completely burnt out i feel like the test questions didnt represent my situation but idk it was developed by professionals guy 3 kept asking me what techniques i was using to manage my stress and i kept telling him i dont have any healthy coping mechanisms and even if i do they arent working well enough i can feel things just getting worse and part of me wants it to so that maybe then i could say things like im cant get out of bed and not well im fine now but im on the verge of not being able to get out of bed and i feel like shit all the time how do i get a professional to take me seriously is mindfulness the only option for stress management thanks,1

is addiction causing you stress many of us struggle with various types of addictions internet cigarettes alcohol gambling etc addiction puts lots of pressure on our own self and our loved ones how many of us have thought about the origin of our addictions and the reasons why its so hard to get rid of these habits one of the biggest question remains is whether we are substituting our empty lives with these habits that are no longer serving our higher goals there are several research studies that directs us to the fact that past trauma could be the reason for addiction as a coach i have worked closely with people with addiction issues and so far my realization is that many of them had gone through some form of abuse trauma in the past abuse can come in different forms physical mental sexual psychological and emotional it is quite important to identify our past trauma and get some help rather than sweeping our problems under the carpet and living in denial as humans we all need self care and community support to stay healthy and happy practicing spiritual activities meditation mindfulness etc will help us to heal our past trauma and wounds,1
i posted a meme on facebook about my mental health being bad rn and no one reacted or responded i just saw in my feed that a friend copied and posted it themselves has loads of comments and reacts saying how loved she is and how much she matters to everyone i know its stupid but it just got to me i mean i barely have any friends on facebook and i know i wouldnt want to be a bother on any of them anyway but like 1 care react would have been something sorry just needed to vent edit i just want to be a bit clearer that the people commenting and stuff on her post are not shared friends she has a large friends list of people i dont know where as i barely have anyone on my friends list also i know facebook and social media are just awful for mental health but i sadly cant delete it as i need to for my business and sadly as much as i try and just use it only for that i get sucked in from time to time while im editing i just want to say thank you for the supportive messages and everything you have made me feel a lot better though im sorry to have vented at you all i kind of figured this post would mostly be ignored as well and im sure there are far more needing people you could offer support to but still thank you x,1

i have no desires no ambitions hell i dont even think my life can be considered living but i love it and i think i will continue to live like this as long as i can only feeling alive when it rains i live through stories through dreams through other people eyes i think ive got a lot of empathy for some reason i lose myself in everything movies books shows videogames i dont care which life i follow as long as it isnt my own i dont feel sad even though sometimes i feel suicidal i even got an attempt behind me i dont really care im 23 and i had a difficult life full of loss and sickness and i dont care for that either im not a dumb person but i didnt and neither intend to follow through with my studies i dont want a job either even though i think i will have to get one in order to get by i just want to live throughout my stories i want to lose myself in there forever i really wish the afterlife will be just that an amalgamation of lives where i forget everything and every time start anew but when i die i remember all the previous ones ive lived for some reason though theres always something that truly makes me feel alive something that makes me happy and with which i share an incredible connection on so many levels the rain i love the rain so much i always end up with a smile on my face whenever it starts to pour down its like some kind of miracle of nature and every time i wish it could go on forever rain is amazing its so dynamic and refreshing the smell of dust it leaves its the absolute best and it feels like when i can finally smell it when it starts raining in that moment i truly feel alive in no other instance i can feel that way or can i replicate it i dont care for love but i think im in love with this weather i think i only live to see the next time it will rain over and over also the same way the rain makes me feel alive the sun makes me feel dead inside and in pain a physical pain it often enough translated into the real world i swear it has debilitated me in many occasions the heat i cant stand it the sweat brings stickiness it burns my eyes the sky becomes so monotonous it could just be dead for all i cared really the sun sucks i often wish for it to disappear forever i dont care if i would die or the planet and all the people in it would die i really just want it gone every single day of my life my first thoughts when i wake up every single day are is it raining please please make it so today will be a rainy day i dont really know why im writing this maybe i hope to find someone who can understand me even though i doubt anyone even in a situation similar to mine could feel in exactly in the same way as i do i think this world is amazing and that life is worth living but i hate the sun and i have having to do things i dont want to do in order to be able to enjoy its wonders it surely seems like the kind of cry a baby would do but its a very strong sentiment i dont want to work i dont want to do nothing i just want to read books and enjoy the falling rain forever,1

i just want to quit everything its a long story but ill tell as shortly as possible im gay so i worked very hard for my entire life to move to europe to study and live there after i finished my bachelor very successfully i got very ill nothing too serious but 4 separate illnesses piled up at the same time and this ruined me i had started a masters but i had to quit and move back in with my family in my country my country has mandatory military service being in the shape that i was and also being gay i was in no shape for military service so i started a masters in another field that i thought was easy the military service is postponed if youre studying i took care of my illnesses in the meantime except for my serious allergy problem whose treatment lasts approx 5 years im still ongoing through that treatment ive arrived at the thesis state of my masters but gosh i just hate it so much i dont want to do it anymore its so stressful and also so pointless that i just want to quit everything i simply dont want to do it and no force can make me want to because im a very straightforward and authentic person if i dont want to truly do something i just cant do it but if i quit i would have to go to military service and im still going through treatment i could try getting an exemption by saying im gay theres such a system in place but im not sure if they would believe me and im not sure what it indicates for my future i cant get a postponement because of my treatment they dont listen to that even though the actual reality is that im having breathing problems all day long thats the life i have to go through the only thing i could possibly do is to sign up to say that im gay and funny thing is i have a 398 gpa so externally it doesnt make sense to quit but yet still i hate the program so much it makes every awaken moment of life feel like disaster i hate this i dont want to be in this situation and i dont want to live like this but yet im tied up and cant move on i can barely lift my head up anymore and i dont know what to do i guess i literally dont want to do anything i just want to quit everything thats all also im extremely lonely i dont have any friends that want to see me and no one proper wants to date me either i was doing really fine in life and i knew the value of it too never took it for granted i was happy and i wanted to make other people happy too but my life got ruined i cant solve any of this anymore and i feel like im out of my mind i just dont want to do anything anymore i just want to quit thanks for listening any advice is appreciated,1

having depression in your genes sucks i got my depression from my mom who probably got it from her dad who probably got it from his parents who you get the idea and it fucking sucks because i feel like there is no way to truly help yourself when you were predetermined by fate to be a sad piece of shit all the time i cant even relate to other depressed people most of them just seem to be depressed because of their circumstances in life and yeah thats valid too but at least thats something that can be changed i know its probably toxic to say this but i genuinely hate seeing other people recover from depressive episodes because there is no escaping my genes i will never have depression be in my past its always going to affect me regardless of what i do with my life or what meds i decide to take its always going to fuck me over because thats what my genes want to happen i guess lmao anyways seeing other people get better while i know that im just going to be coping for the rest of my life feels devastating there is no escape from this shitty brain,1
i dont feel anything anymore the last time i felt anything was last tuesday when i was feeling anxious for school the next day ever since then i havent been able to feel happy or sad or anything im in marching band and we had our first performance first game and went to an amusement park for a parade all in three days yet i didnt feel nervous for any performance or excited to ride any rides i dont know whats wrong with me,1
stress anxiety from workplace disagreements sorry if this is too minor for this subreddit but i would really like to get other peoples perspective brief background i have struggled with quite significant anxiety and resultant relatively minor depression over the last decade or so i am on medication now after having been signed off work for a month a short while ago recently i have felt very resilient and enjoying the challenges of work for the first time again in years i have had the strength and inclination to put myself out there a bit more at work and to have my voice heard on issues and disagreements where i genuinely feel like i know better or have something to add this has then led to disagreements that make me feel uncomfortable and anxious again they are probably minor things to normal people but i cant help but let them get to me and once i start to fight for something i struggle to let it go which makes things worse and then i feel worse my instinctive takeaway from these experiences are that i should not speak up and i need to just be passive and let others dictate as that seems to be the only way i can handle it and not cause the situations that cause my anxiety does this make sense or resonate with anyone else am i just wrong whats the best way forward i just want to be happy and calm in life,1

i want to be lovable or at the very least likeable i feel doomed to be this troubled person forever and i feel as though no matter how hard i try it always shows on my face thats why it always surprises me when people who seem so wellfunctioning and liked open up about their mental health struggles i wish i could at least have some lightness about me and not feel so shrouded in anxieties sadness and grief and no one wants to be around that at the end of the day and i completely understand that i worry for the people that do choose to be around that as they tend to have a sort of savior complex maybe i am so used to my own isolation that i find it difficult to be with others for long periods of time or that my internal self critic manifests itself on others i feel as though i repel people emotionally after they initially express interest i wish i could at least pretend better,1

collecting pieces of my shattered porcelain soul ive been meaning to make a personal post for a while its been a difficult time for me and ive really been struggling lately sitting at my terminal typing this out im finding my words and sentences difficult to conceive perhaps this is an unsurprising reveal an antithesis of the otherwise happy mask i don the mask that says that im okay this is unlike my time earlier this year from my situation with whom we shall call lt and i would be doing myself a grave injustice if i were to have specified it as such the root of my current status quo is complex and unending not simply onedimensional but a great web of connected overlapping and intertwined vertices no to contemplate and dwell on the sources of my pain is not why i started writing this post its not why i had if youre reading this decided to publicize it on the internet expressing myself and delivering my most blatant clear and real cry for help was my reason to be blunt ive lost a lot of motivation and will lately ive lost friends family and most importantly ive lost myself i know that on the surface anyone would be envious of my life im a wellrespected straighta student whos involved everywhere both academically and nonacademically with my foot in the door all across the hemisphere and connections all across the globe with dozens of open job offers and opportunities to ditch my life and move away and make six figures doing what i love and loving what i do with this and that and so much more and more and more and more i make people laugh and i make people smile i make people feel happiness when they havent in a while and i stay with them and i help them and im there for them because thats what i do i help people i look like someone who has everything figured out and i guess i do have a lot figured out im a star student a valued and highlycontributing member of everything im a part of and im amazing at my job and i exceed at everything i do i guess i have a lot figured out but i dont have everything figured out to say that ive lost my friends family and myself may be confusing to an outside observer who sees friends and family still loving me and surrounding me and myself still putting on a smile sustained throughout every shared moment bringing laughter and light and happiness to every room im in perhaps this is nitpicking the specifics of the english language but theyre wrong my friends and family still have me and they havent lost me i said i lost them i said i lost myself anyone whos ever felt this and i know theres a nonzero number of individuals who have who do understands what the subtle but important difference is we understand how its possible for ourselves to lose the people we love and the people we care about without them losing us because its not a matter of possession company relationship or otherwise its about identity there arent words for me to describe it there arent words for me to explain it to someone whos never felt it before ive been writing this for hours already and words are so so difficult to come across ive lost everyone and myself this life that i live this life riddled with clinical anxiety depression ptsd and a physical disability is not a life for the faint of heart i walk through hallways every single day not fully accepting that i am me i look into the mirror and see another person this life is not a life that you want to live so please do not be envious of it im so utterly stressed i love all the clubs and organizations im a part of and i easily excel at both work and school but its exhausting when i have so much emotional baggage to carry on my shoulders my ptsds never gotten better my soul is not a golden model it is one of porcelain dropped and shattered and crushed into a trillion minuscule pieces scattered by the winds of time i truly live two worlds one of false happiness and laughter and love and one of the deserted land in which my consciousness wanders a barren wasteland devoid of life myself never truly able to be me eternally wondering struggling and falling this isnt something ive only recently begun feeling but something ive always felt only repressed and not allowed to surface for so long im in so much pain and i dont want to be in pain anymore impale me with a steel hook and savagely tear my heart out ill never function like you i cant be normal i cant be happy thats been me,1

i get specific symptoms while doing specific tasks and need help determining how to move forward since starting my first real job august 2020 ive been experiencing some symptoms while working chest pressure sometimes although rarely causing hypertension or difficulty breathing inability to concentrate the symptoms may persist for some time after stopping the days work although rarely for long they get worse throughout the week and seem to be the mildest on mondays they are also mildest in the morning worsening throughout the day the symptoms are worsened while performing difficult tasks or tasks that have no clear way towards a solution while doing tasks that i know how to solve the symptoms are lessened and sometimes disappear completely i work as a software developer i am 24 and male while the symptoms are present i can hardly get any work done i cannot concentrate or think clearly after a workday i am completely drained and have little mental capacity to do anything but watch netflix it has gotten to a point where i am drawn towards avoiding work to not experience the symptoms hence me seeking help here obviously im writing this post here because i suspect this may be related to stress i dont have any obvious stressors in my life and generally do not feel stressed my main inquiry is how i should move forward ive scheduled a doctors appointment but how do i treat this do i seek out psychological therapy should i consider another career path might this be a physical condition id really love some input,1
i 21f have no idea how bad it is i dont know if what im feeling is valid or just making a mountain out of many molehills but i just want to vent about it i feel like theres this big grey cloud covering all of my emotions and thoughts cluttering everything up when i lay in bed and stare at the ceiling everything feels bad and scary and like im going to fail in everything i like to envision it as a big ball of yarn that i slowly pluck and with every stressor i can name a little bit of yarn comes loose my parents college add my inability to start things finish things or really do anything and many other things i cant quite put my finger on i dont know if this is the right sub to let everything out it may even span multiple subs i dont know maybe in the future ill make a complete post detailing why i think i am stressed but really it boils down to this college is going okay im in an internship i feel i am doing an inadequate amount of work and i feel so scared that there are so many hours ive spend doing nothing because of my inability to focus and probably depression but depression hasnt been diagnosed my inability to focus comes from add it has been diagnosed late in high school when i was still a minor and although i was open to it my parents didnt want to send me to therapy because they like to pretend nothing is wrong with me my parents may not belong in justnofamily just yet but theyre getting close they dont understand me and have admitted to that they dont want to help me with my add and have made no move to understand it better they literally forgot they dont even know what it is or what it means they dont let me have any boundaries even now at 21 they dont treat me like an adult while they expect adult behavior and responsibilities from me i feel helpless simple questions from family set me right on edge the thought that there are two months left in the internship send me right into panick mode i cant relax because my parents expect me to do homework and when i dont have homework they expect me to work ahead i dont do that i try to play games or draw or anything to relax but i am so focused on not getting caught i dont find joy in it on top of that i feel that i simply dont get enough out of my free time to really justify not doing homework my girlfriend has been my rock my wakeup call my stress relief but she has her own college problems and i dont see her as often as id like not by distance but simply because of the fact that i directly go home after im done at the internship she cant help me any more than she already has so what should i do are there any methods of relieving stress right now without turning to a therapist what are the best ways to try and talk to my parents about eventually seeing a therapist,1

let go of stress negativity emotional pain 3 years ago i left dubai and moved to a small town in hungary because i fell in love with a girl she did not want to move to dubai so i decided to move to hungary i left my beautiful house high paying job my car my big fat salary and my favourite city in the world behind to move in with my girlfriend but 3 months after moving to hungary she ditched me i was completely broken she left because i wasnt earning as much as i was in dubai i was in a town where my brown skin was a problem and i didnt speak the local language in public i was called a terrorist a migrant and even a gypsy life was tough but i fought myself out of it stress negativity and emotional pain can destroy anyone i was on the verge of suicide but i had a choice to either sulk or lift myself up i chose the latter some of these points mentioned below have helped me big time i hope you guys can relate to it let me know if the stuff here makes any sense 5 steps to let go of stress negativity and emotional pain 1 dont take anything personally if someone says something mean to you it is because they are hurting inside and dont know how to ask for love now if a person is being mean i listen to them look at them with compassion and choose not to retaliatethis typically helps defuse that persons pain 2 replace negative thoughts with positive action as a child i often had negative thoughts about myself and others which would cause me to feel bad many of my thoughts centered on the fact that i didnt feel good enough these thoughts caused me a lot fear and anger and stopped me from doing things that i felt would bring me joy when you start thinking negative thoughts about yourself or others tune in to your intuition about what would bring you fulfillment when you devote your energy to things that bring you joy and satisfaction in life theres less energy to devote to negativity 3 love yourself unconditionally because if you dont who will every day i reinforce how much i love myselfwhybecause it feels good and who doesnt like to feel good one simple way i do this is by telling myself in my head with a smile on my face i love myself unconditionally then i sit in the feeling of love that arises 4 forgive if you dont youre letting your past control and poison you and youre the one who ends up feeling bad i felt so bad in my adolescence as a result of having negative feelings toward people that i never want to feel that way againthe more anger i would feel toward someone the more my life felt miserable and chaotic to forgive people i needed to surrender to the things that had caused me stress they were in the past and they were only still bothering me because i was letting them as a result of letting them stress me out similar issues would arise in other relationships until i acknowledged that i had to do something about it the way i see it now is if i had rotting garbage in my home i would not keep it because it stinks and its not good for my healthso why would i hold onto negative feelings that are causing me problems in order to let go and forgive i first got into a calm mindseti did this by focusing my attention on my breath which brought me into the present moment next i thought about the person and said in my head i forgive persons name for hurting me and i release any anger and pain i feel about persons namei send persons name unconditional love doing this simple exercise helped me clear so much negativity from my life that i felt like a whole different person you may have to do this many times before you feel comfortable with itit can take a while to fully surrender because we often hold a false sense that these negative feelings are serving us it helps to remember the first lessondont take anything personally the person who hurt you was also hurting it doesnt condone what they did but it does make it easier to forgive 5 meditation music music is powerful research shows that music can alter a persons mood and behaviour as well as their physical body thats why in our fastpaced modern world the calming effects of music are so significant meditation is powerful too it can provide clarity and innerpeace when these two worlds music and meditation meet they deliver benefits that impact your entire life listening to calming music can have a positive impact on your meditative practice and your life listening to music while meditating is a reduction in the levels of stress and anxiety when you listen to pleasant and soft music during meditation you will feel calmer and the pressures of life fade outside of meditation studies show that workplaces where meditation music is playing experience much lower levels of stress and lower levels of stress and anxiety than those that have loud music or no music playing at all i personally love this short video which i have started listening to every morning as i wake up head to bed honestly its a 3 minute video but i listen 40 to 50 seconds of it i hope you guys could benefit from it too,1
struggling with work stress and making mistakes ever since covid kicked off ive been extra stressed from work due to managers riding everyone extra hard compared to usual im a 4th year apprentice mechanic and ive been making more mistakes at work than usual nothing major just little things but far too often leaving job orders in a customers car breaking things that are easy to break but i shouldnt have broken etc my managers have had several private chats to me now about the issues and have basically just said that if i dont get on top of it im fired it doesnt help that my direct manager gets very stressed and takes it out on others especially me getting abusive at times im currently on my 4th week of 6 weeks off i had originally booked for an overseas trip which kind of just adds to the despair of the situation ive started working out nearly every day when i never used to ive cut my drinking to next to none and started eating more fruit and veg and less junk im feeling good for the time being while im on holidays but as i get closer to going back to work the worrying is starting again and it affects my sleep i was wondering if any of you guys would have any tips to deal with work related stress and help with focus during work i tend to spend a lot of time that i should be focusing worrying about what may happen and it snowballs from there cheers,1

ive told 2 college professors that i am suicidal in less than 3 days of each other and i was quite shocked at their reactions i sorta expected a very stigmatized reaction for some reason the first professor blew up on me in immediate concern for my wellbeing he too had actually been through similar circumstances when he was younger and the second professor he had a close friend who was suicidal and very depressed as well he was very calm throughout the whole conversation actually that was a really fucking cool thing to have a legit chat about mental health with college professors edit i really cant express enough how reassuring all of your supportive comments are i would like everyone to know that i actually just recently started therapy for the first time this semester and it is doing wonders hopefully i get the courage to schedule with the on campus psychiatrist soon to see if medication can help also thank you all for reminding me that people do care about others thank you greatly,1
afraid i know for a fact theres a convict stalking about in my woods right now,1
my therapist thinks im too depressed for therapy so my therapist that ive only seen two times thinks im not a good candidate for therapy she thinks that im too depressed for it despite being on heavy medications that im going to see a doctor about and reevaluate in a few weeks she didnt think that a combination of psychotherapy and medications combined would work for me instead she suggested ect treatment after only talking for 80 minutes total after doing extensive research this is only offered after you have tried a combination of both therapy and meds and have psychotic symptoms and have a high risk for suicide all of which i dont have i am severely depressed but my life is incredibly stable for the first time in my life i know how to handle my depression and my anxiety and do so very well which she agreed on mind you but she still thinks im too depressed and shes afraid therapy might make it worse ive done cbt before only for my anxiety so i am well aware it might get much worse before it gets better yet the cbt was very successful and no matter how hard it got and how badly i wanted to quit i still showed up for every single appointment and did every homework i got i am not a quitter nor will i ever be all i want is some help to get better without frying my brain is that too much to ask for am i unreasonable for thinking that psychotherapy and trauma therapy might be a good place to start just needed to rant and vent a little so if anyone actually read this far thank you redheart,1

many pandemicdepressives didnt have empathy for mental health sufferers until it affected them once the pandemic is over theyll recover and resume their lives forgetting their empathy for others ive been depressed from childhood and no one cared imagine going through racism bullying social exclusion and loneliness from 5 years old to adulthood ive put in tremendous efforts in improving myself and meeting people through various ways yet i get turned down because of my appearance race and being not conventionally attractive etc or my quiet introverted personality and therefore written off as weird how wonderful it would be to have friends that genuinely care some of these people posting on social media about caring for others and reaching out are doing it just for the likes and popularity so many of these phonies are the same assholes that would not give me people like me the time of day despite reaching out to them theyre nothing but insincere and hypocrites that have in the past contributed to the loneliness and mental health issues of others edit thanks for the support and awards also i changed the all to some in the 4th paragraph because some of you are so sensitive about that and it was your only takeaway from this entire discussion,1

you can never have an honest conversation about suicide when i was 18 someone at school had found a rough draft of my suicide note i had planned on killing myself at the end of that week the following events were an absolute shit storm my at the time girlfriend was devastated my father was a wreck my mother acted cold to me and the whole school found out that their thoughts on that crazy asshole may have been justified its been almost 3 years since then and ive seen therapists twice since the part i hate the most about therapists is how you cant have an honest conversation about suicide and wanting to die when they ask do you have thoughts of suicide or have you made plans of suicide i know i have to answer no because if im honest and say yes this is my plan then im going to get thrown back into the psych ward for an indefinite amount of time for my safety if i cant be 100 honest with the person thats supposed to help me then how am i supposed to get any help when i realized this i stopped seeing a therapist even after she promised me to keep coming in at this point i feel like i have to fight this alone,1
first steps think i might be depressed and dont know where to go initially so im not sure exactly what sort of mental health professional i need to make an appointment with therapist psychologist etc but i feel i need to and would appreciate any advice ive been feeling not quite myself for about six months now i know everyone is dealing with issues trying to live through a pandemic and i had been holding up fairly well until just recently right before the pandemic my dad died kind of unexpectedly and i really hadnt been able to spend time to grieve that before we were thrust into this weird time were in now i would not say i am severely depressed but its almost like i have the pervasive question in my head of whats the point of living whats the purpose to be clear i am not suicidal in fact the thought of killing myself is extremely scary to me im scared of death but i just feel kind of meh about life lately i feel like my emotional bucket is empty i dont know if this is just really persistent right now because of the current pandemic or if i need to be medicated and then if i did need to be how that works is that something you can do to get you over the hump or is that something you have to be on permanently tia,1

it all feels useless like what procrastinating all day and be in constant inner turmoil about being completely able to make yourself better and more skilled yet you just dont and you guide others to change at the end of the day youre just a stupid piece of shit who deserves no one and in return youve earned nothing to begin with and then after youre done you just sit on your phone browsing occasionally learning something because it effectively neutralises your mind as if putting you on morphine because you want this to stop for just a second,1
i think im not jealous for anyone anymore and it scares me i feel like my situation is beyond fixing because i start to not feel jealous anymore i used to see people online doing things i wanted to do like going for shopping or hanging out with friends i always hoped for the day that i will feel good and read again my books have my job and doing the things i love but everyday i feel more and more that these things dont appealed to me anymore i see all those people having great time and im terrified of their lives i somewhat pity them i prefer staying in my misery than doing all these things everything really seem meaningless to my eyes even their lives seem empty and they cant convince anymore of their great time the only thing that im still jealous of is their ignorance if they really are ignorant but other than that nothing seems fun anymore i dont believe that there is anything that could make me happy anymore even if tomorrow i had the ideal life and all my dreams would come true i wouldnt be happy the only way that it could change the things is if the world would come upside down if everything had changed the structure of the society was totally different even if my life was still crap i would had a hope for something better now i dont,1

do you ever doubt the validity of your depression and just think that the reason you cant do normal things is just because youre a bad person my depression has depression bro a lot of the time i doubt that i have a mental illness and blame myself for being incapable of doing normal things i feel empty all the time yeah i have a diagnosis yeah but i still manage to doubt myself anyways it almost feels like its normal to feel empty its strange when people tell me they can do their school work have a job and feel happy by second nature it seems like feeling this way is normal but i also feel like im alone in this its weird i tell myself things like this isnt because of the depression its because youre worthless and incapable of doing anything i tell myself that this is an excuse to sit in bed and do nothing but deep down i would give anything in the world to feel happiness i hope this isnt just me like deadass i dont know if im the only person who feels like this and if i am thats just gonna scare me,1

my mom died yesterday my mom died yesterday night at around 12 am she killed herself i can only assume she has schizophrenia the previous 2 weeks of her death she was acting totally different nothing of herself she was going on about god she was never religious and how if we dont believe in him we are going to hell it all began from when she was dating this guy joseph and when she came home that night she was totally different i now live with just my dad and sister and all to remind i am just 16 it really hurts she is dead all i can think about it her death i cry off and on and some moments i feel fine then others times i feel numb my family is being supportive but none of them understand this pain they remind me it wasnt her i know it wasnt her my mom would have never done this to us it doesnt change the fact my mom is selfish for killing herself i can still hear the gun shot in the bathroom it hurts to even go into the bathroom to even touch any of her stuff i mourn with happy pictures of her still painful to think she would change so fast i looked through notebooks of hers she used to write like it was her life she wrote lists and lists of things to do chore lists grocery lists activity listsetc it was never ending my mom was always full of life always ready to take on what life gave her she never considered suicide the night of when she killed herself she was preparing us all night it hurt to hear her talk like that she had cuts all over her body and bruises on her thighs from the 48 hours she disappeared that morning she came home naked and wrapped up in blanket apparently walking around the city i want to let every one know that no matter what cherish the people around you and take the sad things seriously never forget that that may be the last time youll see them,1

good step towards progress hey everyone i just joined the group and i think i should share a relatively good breakthrough i had with my stress management i work a grueling job as an essential worker at a grocery chain in the midwestern us this job has really seen me go through the ringer in regards to bending over backwards to make my company happy we are the number one store for sales in the company and one of the ways we are number one is through our online ordering where we seem to have a no ceiling rule where we with accept x number of orders per hour to where around thanksgiving we were doing easily 3040 orders a half hour roughly 10 containers to hold itemsorder couple that with me being the pallet puller who pulls all the orders out to where we let people drive up for their order couple it with a thankless job where theyre only using me for my size it gets to be stressful anyhow last night i cracked and i decided to start medicating with otc stress relievers so i bought some of that ashwagandha stuff or whatever and took one about 6 pm last night two hours after my shift and it was amazing i didnt feel quite as stressed and as someone who lives naturally with a lot of stressfrustration due to a spectrum disorder and a high stress job i felt honestly the best i have felt since maybe before covid19 took over our lives honestly i hope to leave the job soon due to the stress causing me a lot mental struggles outside of work but i think the ashwagandha was a small step towards becoming less stressed after a year,0

its happening again i can feel it building inside of me i cant stop overthinking my thoughts are like a riverconstant i can feel my soul screaming internally i can feel the mental breakdown that hasnt happened yet and i dont know what to do the saddest part of depression is that while there are resources out there those of us with clinical depression know that only time is the answer the light at the end of our dark tunnel time has to pass but what do i do in the meantime i feel myself becoming unmotivated isolated fatigued reminiscent and i begin to daydream about random things envy is the ugliest color on someone but lately i find myself wearing it looking at people and wishing i was successful like them happy like them loved like them and beautiful like them im comparing myself to everyone again the trauma i thought i dealt with is showing up again i just feel like im drowning and im gasping for air watching others breathe but im not at the brink of death yet i guess this is what it feels like before the ugly shit happens ignorance really is bliss isnt it,1

why are people so stupid so i work with a guy that is not taking the virus seriously he lets his kids go out and do whatever they want hes already had to be tested 7 times and ive had to be tested twice i guess he just dont care who he gets sick ive tried talking to him about it and he said it his choice to do what he and his kids do its a free country i have a mother with cold that lives with me and i swear to god if he gets her sick he will pay im constantly worried about covid now because he wont do the right thing,1
i dont think that i can cope anymore hello reddit im gonna make it short i have been thinking about suicide a lot lately all my thoughts kinda end up at this topic i am a 24 old musician i thought that making music is enough to fulfill me but i havent been playing any instrument in the last six months i fucked up my past romantic relationships to the point that im too scarred to start a new one i smoked so much weed in my youth that ive stopped entirely 6 months sober now i just feel empty all the time i feel it creeping up on me again my consumption of alcohol grows every week and at some point im about to give in being sober and lonely just feels like waiting at this point i can feel myself relapsing with weed cigarettes and a lot more loneliness in the near future i know this will probably lead to my suicide but i honestly never expected much of this life anyway so i am kinda okay with this,1
ive never had a day start out as good as today has i work at a wendys burger joint at the moment usually at the drive through window and anyone whos worked fast food will know that its rarely a fun job well today started out with a bunch of rain our store doesnt have an awning so i was getting soaked pretty typical so far but then it was just rapid fire wholesomeness i had one of our regulars hand me a 5 tip and tell me that i deserve it and that im a great worker i had a pretty damn attractive person ask for my number im already engaged but that felt really nice to hear and just before my break i had 5 customers pay for the person behind them in a row and the only reason the last guy didnt is because there wasnt anyone behind him now im a pretty cynical person so im expecting something awful to happen at some point today to balance everything out but man my self esteem is through the roof today and people are being so nice is there something in the soda edit thanks for the awards,0
i cant focus worth shit everything someone says is a garbled mess my brain cant distinguish words songs that i used to love seem to be foreign to me im making rookie mistakes at work and remembering tasks is near impossible im pretty sure im about to be fired from my job i used to shine at what i did as my career ill have a good week and then i mess up and spiral down this black hole where i want to end my life i need to learn coping skills and im afraid of what i will do if i dont,1
im dying all alone hello reddit im a 54 m who has recently been diagnosed with a terminal disease according to doctors i have a limited time untill cancer spreads everywhere in my body that however is not what i want to talk about ive had a hard life i spent most of my childhood all alone with no friends always desperate for tiniest bit of affection my parents were both too busy with their jobs to show affection to me while im deeply grateful for all the things they did for me and various ways they shown how much they care about me back in that time i didnt understand any of that all i could see was how other parents hug and play with their kids but my parents didnt i did a huge deal of stupid stuff in my childhood to get their attention so many stupid and embarrassing things that i dont remember anymore since i really dont want to overall i hated my childhood ive never had any problems with my gender and behaved manly because i was comfortable with it however since a long time before i stepped into my teen years i knew i was maybe a little bit different i hated sports instead i really loved reading books there were some other examples but like i said i dont remember much about my childhood i also didnt think they were a big deal when i became a teenager i discovered that unlike any other teenage boys i knew i was weirdly not interested in girls for some reason i thought that ill probably get there in time i didnt now i was different in a very conservative and judging society a society which even divorced people get looked at with anger when i realized that instead of getting attracted to girls i like boys i panicked i was only 14 i knew very little i thought ill get out of this mess as i grow older in that period of time i thought i was the only one like that i was different for the rest of my teenage life i ignored that hoping for a change in my preference in the future when i grew older i became aware of what situation i was in i was gay even to this day i cant say that word without my voice shaking i tried everything to change it did not work many many questions were raised in my head like why am i like this how am i going to live like this i encountered a huge moral religious and cultural dilemma it was horrible untill this day ive got no answers it was simply so much for me to process this quickly affected me and became a major source of depression anxiety social insecurities and etc i gained a lot of weight as a result and went through a very depressing path due to all the stress and anxiety i encountered achromotrichia and my hairs started becoming white at early ages then i went through a severe phase when i was 18 in which i tried confronting myself i tried my best to accept who i am i didnt want to change just wanted to come clean and admit it it was not successful i fell down a hole of worse distancing and anxiety from 2 of my friends whom i came out to one refused to believe what i am and one cut ties with me my best friend even though he could not believe it was actually supportive but soon he moved far away in a different state i had no one to talk to my family didnt know what was wrong with me and everything they did to help me only made it worse i couldnt stand how sad my parents would get if i told them what i was after all they did for me i couldnt bring tears to my moms eyes and sadness to my dad i spent about a month just waking up eating and staring at my room with no purpose i finally had it decided after 32 days i started planning my suicide everything was set on that day i already did everything and i went to bed early that night so that id be ready for the big day as i was tying the rope around my neck i heard my little sisters laughter i burst into tears once again i was being selfish how could i make her little heart sad how cruel can someone be to hurt a little girl like that i stopped i knew this would happen again if i dont make any changes so i did i promised my self never to think of that issue again i suppressed my sexual desires i kept myself busy with other stuff so that i wouldnt get distracted i was once again able to wake up without immediately remembering what i was i could live my pathetic life again when i was aware of my condition i made myself a promise that i wouldnt emotionally hurt anyone and that i dont do anything about my sex life fun fact im still a virgin til this day despite my familys pressure i didnt get married how could i force myself to like a women and ruin her life why would i start a family which i cant love the way i should why would i ruin someone elses life because of my selfishness i didnt date or confess to anyone either as far as i knew i couldnt live with the emotional weight of accepting who i am how could i enter a relationship and transfer all my insecurities to another person the night that i made myself that promise i very well knew this means i will die all alone with no one to hold me hug me or kiss me funny how i still crave human contact though i didnt have any even when i was a kid rest of my life was boring i lived i had a good job with good payment thats it i never felt happy i had some fallbacks but mostly tried eliminating my feelings i never told anyone what i was again i lived as the creepy alone man who lives next door and now i have cancer with a much more limited time than ever im actually kinda happy itll all end soon i only wish i could be happier without all these regrets i wouldve wished a world in which gay people were not looked at differently but i cant imagine how would that go id also wish for me to be straight but i honestly have no idea how that works not once i was interested in women to have a sense of that i even tried looking at pictures of hot women its hilarious i know for a long time in my young years to see if anything happens but it didnt so at the end im soon dying never kissed the person i loved or even met the person i loved full of depression and sadness and 54 years of loneliness i dont exactly know who will read this i never got noticed in my life i dont see why i should be noticed now i also dont know how much time i have left so i say to the world farewell i didnt hate you but i hated myself the most,1
i really hate how it come and goes in waves at one time i feel all right a moment later i feel like im the worst fill in the brackets again,1

my day today i tied a belt around my throat and hung it from the ceiling i was standing on the edge of the chair when i slipt the knot was t strong enough and came untied from the ceiling and i fell all through this my girlfriend was ignoring me because my suicidalness upset her too much and she couldnt handle it i got back up tied a stronger knot and tested it it would work so i put the belt around my throat and stood there stood there waiting hoping i would get a text from my girlfriend the only person i have in this lonely world no reply still to the moment im writing this i stood there for about 45 minutes pushing myself to jump to just end it itll be over in about 2 minutes i told myself then i can be at peace for once but i didnt have the courage im fearing for my life lately im scared one of these times ill actually jump ill be gone im getting anti depressants tomorrow but im worried theyre not going to work fast enough im at my breaking point life is so dark and lonely i dont know what to do i dont understand how people enjoy life im struggling im fighting but my mind fights back harder so if this is my last message to the only people who will care goodbye reddit you are the only people who have ever shown genuine support,1
im 17 with a baby and i have to say i am so incredibly happy with my life right now so i live with my boyfriend and his family we have our own loft upstairs before i moved in here i lived with my family who got evicted from our homes repeatedly and never had anything now my boyfriend and i essentially have our own place and i have a tv the tv can play netflix and disney plus so i can watch tv in bed i have a queen sized bed i have an amazing boyfriend who i dearly love and i have a daughter who is literally named after rays of sunlight because thats exactly what she is to me my life seems hard and pathetic to so many people but im doing well in school and im very pleased with where i am everything is great,0
you cant kill yourself think of your family yup no shit every time i would ever come out as suicidal thats always the first thing they say the crutch for my existence is reliant on others wanting me to struggle in the same foggy waters that ive been struggling in for years i know theyre trying to help but it doesnt help it just guilts me into a corner and leaves me being perpetually sad all the time it leaves me with the impression that if i sever ties with everyone to the point where i am in their eyes irredeemable garbage that maybe ill finally be free from my death causing pain to others at least that was my impression before i realized the hard way that it would only shift the pain from my death to my actions so even if i get lucky and my suicide was clean it will never be painless so for now im trapped there is simply no solution other than think about wanting to die and feeling selfish right after edit i sympathize for the people in this thread whos parents are part of the problem that makes this statement much much worse the people trying to help are effectively assuming that you have the same loving parents and probably tell you things about their parents you would kill to have for one day that sounds like a rusted knife to the chest and im sorry you have to deal with that to people with worthless unsupportiave parents i hope you can get out of that situation as soon as possible and find a support group and i hope the cretins that drive their kids to suicide eventually receive the same torment that they have dished out,1
i wish i could die in my sleep i wish i could die in my sleep peacefully im so sick of waking up,1
does anyone else hurt so much emotionally that it feels physical it feels like i constantly have a negative feeling in my chest thats constantly there all day but feels like it gets way worse when i feel more lonelysadnegative ive never hugged anyone before so when i sleep i hug a really soft blanket i have to feel at least somewhat better but i always feel even more lonely and i usually cry and ive noticed that feeling in my chest gets much worse when i feel worse emotionally,1
i dont have any methods for stress relief all of my old techniques for managing stress either are bad for me or they dont work anymore every time i get anxious stressed or angry i cant resolve that feeling in any way other than waiting it out this is really putting a lot of strain on my relationship work and hobbies i feel as if im not in control of my life anymore and its all just spiralling away does anybody have any suggestions on new ways to resolve stress or ways to manage it the only healthy management techniques that worked for me was creative outlets but as i get older i feel more obliged to use these in a more formal way and i cant put as much emotion into any of the work i do everything i had is slipping away and i cant maintain hold of anything i enjoy in life does anybody have any ideas,1
i want friends so badly but everytime i try to talk to someone my mind goes completely blank its not that im not trying ive been trying for so many months now its not getting better i dont have the energy to socialize i just feel like a zombie sometimes when will this end i feel so tired and exhausted to the point i cant even have friends,1

i genuinely dont have anyone anymore i dont have any friends who want to spend time with me i have on friend but she doesnt care and i know that she doesnt im not in a relationship and never have been and probably never will be my entire life has been watching other people make friends get into relationships and be happy i know i will be alone until i die i havent hung out with someone in months maybe even a year i try to ask if people wanna spend time with me and go somewhere but they either say no or flake on me i feel like the least important person in this entire world i cant even maintain a friendship so hoping for a relationship is unrealistic im so sad and so tired of crying about this every single night,1
as of an hour ago me and my wife are on our final step to fully adopting our kid all thats left now is a court hearing were so excited ill try and keep this short and sweet its been six months since we took in our girl and almost from the outset we had every intention of fully adopting her sure me and her had our differences mainly because of me and bottling up my emotions over a tragedy we suffered years prior but ive started seeing her as my daughter now and were closer than ever during this time weve had visits from our agency that come and conduct wellness checks on both the living conditions of the house and also to see how were doing especially her and every time its gone smoothly and perfectly at least for their requirements so we had another visit from them today and this was what we anticipated most it was just more paperwork to be submitted to the court as well as an official petition to adoption that we needed to finally complete while me and my wife were doing this though one of the other agents sat with our daughter privately to just talk and ask how things were going if she genuinely wanted to stay with us anything bad that was happening that we werent telling them etc and at the end they brought her back in and said that now all thats left is for them to submit everything to the court for a judge to review they said that hopefully we should expect a response within 30 days but oftentimes its sooner depending on how clean the background check is and a few other things were almost there she our agent said its funny because our daughter while she was extremely happy with how everything was going wasnt nearly as filled with joy as me and my wife were my wife was actually crying and couldnt contain herself she nearly smothered her in her arms giving her a bear hug i hugged her too and just looked her dead in the eyes and said were almost there baby girl before kissing her forehead i mean i just dont know what to say or how to say it at this point this is like a dream come true with everything weve lost but also have gained so much more in the process it breaks my heart thinking about how many other kids her age or around it shes 14 are out there but will never have a permanent home like she will but i try not to think about it and am just thankful we have a kid as perfect as her in our lives,0
how am i supposed to stay productive at work as far as my therapist is concerned i have depressive episodes im on medication but i still have bursts of wtf how do you call that just episodes i guess thanks to the therapy i can handle that in day to day life except for work i sit here 8 hours a day trying to do important work but just failing completely i cant focus on anything even writing mails is hard it makes the episodes so much worse too because i feel like an ultimate failure my boss knows about the depression and that i cant work as hard as i should but even his support doesnt help the situation is there any way some of you get around this kind of problem even just for short periods of time,1
i dont even know if this is normal so for context im 14 and a male and i have massive adhd but the problem is im always thinking and these thoughts can range from good ones it bad ones and the problem is when i tell my brain to stop thinking about something bad my mind just floods me with that one thing to the point were i get mad and then get stressed because i stop thinking normally and if i try day dreaming this memory out some how my brain incorporates that thought into my day dream and i need help ps thank you to anyone who responds,1
i am so thankful for my best friend shes like my sister and i love her ive known my best friend for about 6 years now and im just so happy that she still spends time with me ive never really been able to keep a close friend for more than a couple years so its just so great to just have someone that you can trust someone that you know appreciates you like you appreciate them its so nice that we get to spend so much time together and we never run out of things to say or feel like we cant express ourselves around eachother i can envision her being a lifelong friend and i hope it stays that way that is all,0

talking to my dr tomorrow about adjusting my meds hi all first time posting in rdepression i f42 have probably been battling it all my life but it was manageable until i had kids i likely have mild add as well i used very intense exercise to cope with both before i still exercise every day but i cant do it with the same intensity that i used to because of my age previous injuries and just the fact that i have no time to recover from intense workouts my main symptoms are irritability likely caused by anxiety feelings of hopelessness and loss of interestinability to experience happiness i go through the motions but dont experience enjoyment on any level i feel insecure and stressed in social situations ive worked with a therapist before have gone through many in fact but have found the process unhelpful and even harmful at times but thats a different post i struggled for a year and a half to find a medication that would work for me but im extremely sensitive to side effects here is a list of what ive tried so far and the effects i experienced both good and bad zoloft sertraline drowsiness emotional flatness loss of interest and creativity some relief from tearfulness trintellix vortoxetine upset stomach gi issues no discernible relief from depression prozac fluoxetine very intense headache only took it once lamictal lamotregine off label allergic reaction itching redness lexapro escitolopram hair loss nausea no relief from depression wellbutrin bupropion anxiety nausea no discernible relief from depression cymbalta duloxetine i was prescribed this but was actually too terrified of the side effects to take it adhd meds adderall headache backache major crash helped with interest and focus but i felt too bad to do much dexadrine headache with crash helped with interest but not focus ritalin sedating vyvanse helpful with interest mood and focus extreme irritability with crash i am currently only taking 25 mil of sertraline any more and i cant get up off the couch any less and i dont sleep at night its obviously not cutting it but im absolutely terrified of taking anything else i dont have a support system to take up the slack if im sick for longer than a day or two my relatives all live far away and theyre not very helpful anyway my husband works all the time as he is the main breadwinner i have a friendly neighbor or two but not someone who would take the kids for more than a few hours its me or nothing and i think that might be a big contributor to my problems im talking to my psychiatrist tomorrow but i know hes kind of out of ideas im thinking about asking for the lowest dose of vyvanse possible i have no clue what to do about the antidepressants he doesnt want to repeat a medication and he doesnt want to prescribe older meds as they tend to cause more side effects is there anything we might have missed are there any combinations or supplements that can make side effects more tolerable thanks in advance,1

i feel like mental illness is the only medical condition where people wished they had cancer instead if i had cancer i could say i needed time off work and everyone would be understanding i could apply for and receive disability i could freely tell my patients i was gone for 3 months or whatever bc i was doing chemo no one would suggest that i dont need medicine bc jesus died for my sins i could be slow at work and my coworkers wouldnt think im lazy theyd understand the physical toll cancer inflicts people would rally around me i could post about my journey on facebook without shame when i fall apart over small things people like to one up mentor tell me i dont have it bad at all my health problems would be validated most importantly i wouldnt feel this terrible soul crushing desire to die edit thanks for all the responses let me rephrase something here i dont wish i had cancer i wish people treated depression as seriously as cancer im not trying to diminish the pain cancer causes,1

overwhelmed and its causing chest pressure life is stressful obviously i have been to several years of counseling as a child and i feel i have some pretty healthy coping mechanisms and communication skills lately though life has been overwhelming i am tired all the time and when conflicts happen between my so and i i get physical chest pressure i wouldnt determine this as a pain but more like difficulty breathing normally advice,1
i can barely handle schoolwork its not even that much but im incapable of remote learning i need things explained to me and i cant ask my teachers questions because i dont even know what i dont understand were not even being graded for accuracy anymore but every time i try to do an assignment i panic and break down because i just cant deal with this,1
having wonderful loving supportive family doesnt make you any less depressed i have two extremely loving parents a supportive sister and a handful of close friends who i know would always listen if i needed it i am still extremely depressed and ready to end it all i attempted suicide 4 years ago ended up in the psych ward for 2 weeks and my family and friends visited every day i can barely function anymore i try so incredibly hard every day to be normal to work walk chat and appear fine mentally i am thinking about killing myself for hours every day today i lost it blew off work and slept the entire day i cried to my mother and she cried with me asked me what i needed willing to do anything but it doesnt help there isnt anything wrong with me im young pretty thin and am capable of making friends and keeping them i have a stem degree ive had committed relationships none of that makes me happy the true tragedy of my life is that i know i could do more be more and i just cant ive been told i am strong because i havent done drugs or drank because i powered through my degree because i havent killed myself im not strong im guilted having a family who loves you and you love is a double edged sword love doesnt cure depression it does wrack you with guilt if you even think of attempting it it would destroy my family im not exaggerating they have all told me individually may times that it would my parents would never forgive themselves i would haunt them forever i tried therapy after i got out of the hospital i was on antidepressants i tried different meds i saw 4 different therapists it all just made it so much worse one of my therapists almost got me involuntarily recommitted to the hospital her talking to my parents and ensuring they would be picking me up and taking me home was the only thing that saved me even the good therapists just made me feel worse i would leave every appointment more depressed than i came in i quit trying that after a year the thing about therapy is that you are forced to lie i was suicidal but couldnt talk about it if they suspect anything you get the cops called on you and they forces you into the prison that is the psych ward they force medication on you get you fired from your job and destroy whatever remnants of a life you had my mother is a certified grief councillor she volunteers in hospice and regularly supports grieving people she cant help me talking to her is pointless she will cry and beg me not to it doesnt make me feel better just guilty all this rambling because the truth is that i am without hope my family is dragging me through life all the love in the world and it doesnt make a fucking difference drugs therapy doesnt matter depression is a death sentence and there is no cure my only hope is to distance myself from them and one day just do it push them far enough away that they grieve me and move on that way killing myself wont affect anyone edit thank you to people who are commenting i am having a hard time finding words to reply to people i dont really express myself easily i really appreciate everyone here its nice to feel understood,1
fuck life fuck being awake im honestly angry that im still alive why cant i just fucking die already life is nothing but endless suffering anyway theres no point in living,1
ill be 40 in six months and have wanted to die since i was 12i failed at life and want to die more than ever edit im so sorry guys i spent an hour responding to more comments only to have to delete them because i was mistakenly posting from my main account nonetheless i am grateful to each and every one of you and each and every one of your words for the first time in months i do not feel so alone thank you despite all the years of meds and therapy and crisis counseling and being told things will get better youre a beautiful strong woman and everything will turn out wonderfully if you just have patiencei can say that with less than six months until i turn 40 i feel no less depressed than the day i was hospitalized at age 12 for trying to kill myself via starvation i can say honestly that at that point i had absolutely no trauma in my life my parents did nothing but love and care for me i just so happen to have a depressed brainand the beginning of puberty allowed its awakening i was able to make it through high school because i went to a charter school specifically for kids with emotional disturbances but i only made it halfway through college before i had another fullfledged episode of depression and had to drop out i was walking out of classes because i needed to cry for no reason i still lived at home and about a year later my parents told me i need to work the only job i could do one that allowed me to come and go as i please and take time off when i needed it and still be able to support myself was stripping in the meantime i was violently raped by a friend of mine i couldntt deal with it so i just went to work the next day like nothing happened with a tampon up my ass so i wouldnt bleed everywhere supressed it as long as i could until again i woke up and decided i wanted to die began therapy a few years laterlast i saw he was happily married with children my fucking rapist got the life i wanted and never had while i was able to move out on my own thanks to dancing after 7 years i was vomiting before shifts and my boyfriend at the time had told me that he would never marry me as long as i was dancing so i decided i was mentally well enough to try school again and graduated one year later with my certification in personal training i spent a few years making minimum wage to build my experience and finally i got a fulltime gig with benefits all the while noticing that my boyfriend still didnt seem into marrying me it had been 6 yearshe finally told me we are not financially stable yet even tho he made over 100000 a yearbut alright turns out he was cheating on me with a goddamn stripclub bartender i googled his email because i had forgotten his amazon name and ended up finding a whole bunch of shit that devastated me his reaction was to first say i didnt think youd ever find that well use a different handle than the one you always use next time then to tell me that i needed to move out told him i didnt have the money to move out he said he would pay for the deposit but when i found a placehe couldnt produce it finally told me he didnt want me to leave after all we can work on this blah until six months later when he finally admittedafter 8 yearsthat he didnt want to marry me ever i just wasnt a good enough homemaker i finally asked for help from my one rich aunt got the deposit finally moved out while in the meantime i had been promoted to head pt and trainer for new staff despite the heartbreak at home i actually had a job with a prestigous title for me and an actual successful career i was making enough to pay rent and was on track for another raise until 2 weeks later when i was fired over the phone because one front desk worker said she heard me jerking off a client on an recumbent bike seriously never in one million years would i have ever even thought of doing such a thing but you knowshe was 18 and her boyfriend enjoyed his workouts with me that was enough for her to make sure i never worked there againi was never accused once of jerking someone off when i was a goddam stripper of course with no job and no income i was given one months notice to move out i found a cheap room and was able to get some work at an old colleagues new gym i didnt have a lot of hope for the future but i still had a little and then i got covid and almost died from it its been six months and im still too weak to walk let alone train too much brain fog to really do any sort of work and only have two weeks of unemployment that i had to fight for left i have no money and no job no man has ever decided i was worthy enough of marriage or having a family with my own body has become a shell of itself and the hypoxia from covid as well as the inflammation in my brain from it has made my depression 1000x worse i tell people i need help physically and mentally but all i have to do is say trump could have handled this betterand they basically tell me i should kill myself because saying mean things about trump hurts their feelings or theyre just so tired of the minimal restrictions that they freely admit they just dont care about me or my health anymore because you know people need indoor dining but they dont need me these are people who claim to love me saying these things this is my support system saying these things to me can anyone here honestly say if they were me they would still have hope that things will get better im not doing another 40 years of this and since covid didnt kill me though it came so close i was on oxygen for 6 daysim nearing the point where i just have to do it myself thanks for reading,1
depression is having no drive purpose passion or commitment i go through life with a lingering sense of worry fear doubt uncertainty regret and utter lack of passion or drive i am constantly worried about something going wrong lack focus and passion for what i do professionally and have no confidence in anything i feel like i am going to get exposed as a fraud and get fired and not find another gig toxic mix of having no confidence combined with lack of drive to do anything about it creates chronic and lingering sense of anxiety and the vicious circle continues,1
planning trips stresses me out so much because there are too many variables any advice i have to decide how many vacation days i can take off and predict how many i will need to save for the rest of the year can i get away with flying after a day of work probably not can i get away with arriving home really early and going to work the same day didnt work last time i had to take a sick day to recover from the redeye i have to pick a flight possibly starting and ending at different airports there are multiple airports near me to choose from sometimes i also have the option of arriving at one place and leaving from a different place to come home so many cost vs convenience tradeoffs i have to figure out how im going to get to each airport and whether the cost increase of one thing nullifies the cost savings of the other lyftuber and a little sketchy public transportation cheap but slow inconvenient and several steps to plan and how do i get to train station drive myself and park but convenient ask a friend i dont have many friends i would feel comfortable asking and their schedules probably dont align anyway i have to coordinate with multiple other people at the destination and figure out when their schedules will align with mine which they may not know yet or may recursively depend on my schedule the longer i wait to buy tickets the more sure i am of other peoples plans the longer i wait to buy tickets the more they cost and the fewer options there are there are so many variables and tradeoffs between them and i just get super stressed out and shut down procrastinating until only bad options are left change my perspective or give me tools to help deal with it i can afford to make some of these problems go away by throwing money at them which is nice but im not rich enough to just choose the most convenient option then the traveling itself stresses me out too yay constantly anxious that i will miss some link in the chain and ruin everything,1
friends make all the difference in the world ive said this on another post i made a few hours ago i moved a lot growing up across multiple states and different houses and apartments i got to see a lot of cool things and meet interesting people but it was killer on the friendships its hard to meet someone and establish yourself as being worthy of keeping in touch in such a short time naturally people ebb and flow in and out of your life always will but it definitely affected the way i look at building meaningful connections and how i interact with those bonds everything was very temporary for a long time earlier i was in such a bad state im going through a breakup it was seven years and i met her when i was nineteen i hadnt eaten in two days and i think i might have been dehydrated from my medication i just wasnt paying attention because i was so utterly empty emotionally very tricky time my mom found me passed out because i slept all day probably from just not noticing how i was treating my body and it decided to have a little revolt anyway my mom made me some food and she just hugged me and i felt comforted warmth really warm it was remarkable that at twenty six years old i felt as much as i did from that simple long hug i ate my food and just sat with her blearily waking up from my stupor i was really groggy and had a hard time thinking properly it was like sleeping the deepest of sleeps and waking up from it abruptly we talked about how i was feeling and i just was content to be sad in her presense for awhile it helped in a way i told her later how grateful i was for her shes a good mom i go downstairs i cant even remember why i think i just wanted to move and i get a phone call from a coworker who helped me call off earlier that morning because i was feeling particularly not well today and so i picked up you guys im very lucky to have the people in my life that i do i have never had something like this before the people i work with are the most charming sincere kind and loving people they came and got me thirty minutes away took me to a bar fed me and got me drunk and i couldnt stop laughing i couldnt stop smiling i am feeling fuzzy from my head to my toes i just got dropped off at home things are going to get better and its moments like these where as low as i am people have a way of being able to lift you right on out of that no problem im still very sad im not ready yet but one day maybe with time i will be until then ill just practice love your friends cherish them deeply same for your family sometimes they are all you need,0
selfhatred is exhausting im so hard on myself for not getting as much done as i want to but when youre battling selfhatred and your mind is constantly asking you why you even bother with anything when itll never turn out the way you want it when youll never be good enough to be loved or accomplish anythingits just exhausting to push through those thoughts ill try to do school work for example then some thoughts of selfhatred will creep in and then i get so down and emotionally exhausted and unable to get any work done and its just so frustrating and i feel all alone in it,1
constant tension and stress for years hi everyone ive realised recently that i cant remember the last time i was truly relaxed for a constant period of time since i was 17 im 23 now apart from my first year at university it feels strange to realise thisi remember the feeling of being relaxed after a nice calming bath or having a scented candle burning but i really dont recall a time that i wasnt worried or tense about something like theres always something at the back of my mind or an issue im really worried about im never truly content with my life in the past year ive developed a few health issues all of which have been traced back to being too stressed more recently its neck and shoulder tension and jaw pain i guess ive reached a point where i think enough is enough and need to work to change this aspect of who i am which has been normal for 56 years i find it hard to discipline myself with things like yoga meditation and other mindfulness activities because of the tension but also the fear that it may not work but if i never commit to it it wont have an effect my gp told me to do a little bit each day so i get used to the practice of it id love to know if anyone had been in this situation or can relate have you got any tips on how to move forward i want to be less tense and learn how to manage stress better thank you,1

having a semi busy schedule stresses me out need advice whenever i have one or two things going on after work i feel as though i dont have enough time to relax i feel as though i cant handle a busy schedule and even having a few things to do during the weekend stresses me out and gives me anxiety because i really enjoy time to myself does anyone know how i can get over this without feeling stressedanxious all the time i know people who have super busy schedules they work extra hours have children i dont and somehow still make time to learn new skills in their spare time i really admire people who can keep busy schedules and somehow not breakdown how do people like that not get stressed by all the stuff they do i really want to be able to do more during my day to get somewhere in life but i feel too stressed out when i do too much is it partially because im an introvert i know i have anxiety to work through but i dont know where to start thanks in advance,1

i disappointed everyone that expected great things from me when i was attending high school i was top of my class with a dream of attending an ivy league university particularly mit all my teachers were extremely proud of me my parents were excited for my future in education my peers thought highly of me however once the middle of my junior year came i was faced with an overwhelming mental breakdown and fell into a depression i would spend sleepless nights doing schoolwork with already unstable mental health or i would do completely nothing and think i eventually started to think about why i am doing this and realized that i dont like this traditional route im going on nor will the results of it make me happy as i am already depressed doing the things i should like doing at that moment my life lost its meaning near the end of my junior year into senior i stopped taking care of myself developed insomnia due to my obligation to try and keep up with my ap classes and my thoughts relentlessly wandering and slept in all my classes my teachers parents and peers as a result started looking down at me wondering why i became such a disappointment according to my principal when i wanted to lighten my workload this put me in the deepest depression of my life as i felt i failed everyone and destined to be nothing i would resort to cutting myself drinking taking old prescription pills and withhold from eating as a way to punish myself to make this short i decided to make my main way of attaining happiness is music that is my dream everyone is still disappointed in me and it weighs heavy on me i wish it could go away this was more of a medium to vent instead of ask for help as i am not feeling well at the moment thank you if u actually do read this,1

i hate that i feel like i cant talk or share anything on the internet anymore i was part of a like im not good at talking but like theres some rare niche program that lets you make computer games any time i asked for help in the forums people always responded with yeah i could very easily help you out with your coding problems i see what you did wrong and i could give you advice but instead im just going to laugh at you for being such a bad programmer and then they invited me to a discord and they were all about memes and everytime i chatted there people would post weird pepe meme faces etc and make fun of me then someone invited me to a smaller discord saying its not like that there but it is and whenever i posted on reddit and other places often times people would say is this a troll thread so then i try to say and no this is not a troll thread but then people respond saying this must be a troll thread if you say no this is not a troll thread its so freaking noisy here and i feel very stressed out and anxious about stuff but im too afraid to post about it anywhere i thought it was safe to post in a community for autistic people since i too have autism but a moderator banned me saying the ban reason is that i am a clear bad example of someone with autism i just dont feel comfortable venting anywhere and haters found my private vent videos and reuploaded them on to youtube without my permission at all and my online friend who says he wouldve blocked me by now but hes too nice and he always says depressing negative things to me every day multiple times said people were linking to those videos and making fun of me saying im not mature for venting in those private venting videos that the haters reuploaded from my private vent account onto a public youtube channel without my permission to make fun of me i just dont feel comfortable at all and i feel so bad,1
just a release of stuff ive been dealing with so a little under 3 months ago i renewed my lease with my roommate then about 2 months ago my roommate told me that i he planned on moving out with his bf some time so that i should keep an eye out for a new roommate i assumed he meant for after our current lease was up about a month ago i found out hes going to be moving out real soon and that they had been searching for and shortly after found a house to get together if i absolutely have to i can budget super hardcore and carry out to the end of the lease on this 2 bedroom apartment on my own but im searching for a roommate because id prefer not to have to use an entire paycheck on just my apt bills my best option would be to find a roommate my second best would be to take an offer my apt complex gave me to move into a 1 bedroom here and carry out to the end of the lease without any extra cost other than rent adjustment the issue with this is my current rent is about 440 after being split with a roommate if i moved to a 1 bedroom my rent would be about 730 entirely on my own plus electricity wifi etc added on top of that my 3rd best option would be to move out end the lease early and find a 1 bedroom somewhere else the issue with this is that wed have to give 60 days notice plus 2 months rent so 4 months total for ending the lease early not to mention the cost of starting over at a new place and all that comes with that and unless i found a place and got approved very soon id be most likely moving in november in nebraska where weather is a roll of the dice with disadvantage at the best of times i have had no luck with finding a new roommate and all of this is causing me a lot of stress my current roommate is a good dude and is kinda trying to help out but i dont think he thought this through most of my time lately is searching for any other options or any potential roommates but none are coming to me on top of that i have a financial meeting in the next few days to discuss long term savings plans and a bunch of other stuff that im not entirely prepared for so i have to cram getting all of that ready in a very short amount of time because the stress of all the above made me forget about the meeting until just a few days ago im trying to not have a breakdown about everything but shits hard most of my time when not working at my job or on the above is spent sleeping as a way to try and escape the stress of it all for even a few hours which is more difficult lately because of said stress if you read this thanks for taking the time i just needed to get some shit out into the void of the world,0
i attempted suicide by crashing my car into a highway median at 200 kmh and walked out with a minor concussion i feel like its a sign i need to step up my action against depression what are some things i can do to alleviate my depression the title and this story may sound fake new account to hopefully protect my identity but i swear to you it could not be more real for me i wanted to share this i am not doing this for attention but merely to seek help more questions will be asked at the end of my story as the title describes a miracle has occurred given the severity and intent of the crash the paramedics police doctors nurses and my parents all gave me the most puzzled look of their lives when they asked how fast i was going and i replied 200 kmh i have been depressed for 4 years now nothing has been working and my mental health has declined terribly i have been on multiple medications tried behavioural therapy such as cognitive behaviour therapy cbt and even went a course of electroconvulsive therapy ect first my motivation to do anything went down i couldnt eat do school work and most importantly socialize my social circle grew smaller as my depression grew bigger after 4 years of suffering as well as other health conditions such as horrible eyesight 1000 in each eye with astigmatism sleep apnea and anxiety i figured life wasnt going to get any better and i decided to end my life i drove to the mountains where i decided i would find a large hill go full speed down it and either turn into the median or drive off the road ultimately killing myself about 3 hours from my hometown i found the perfect hill the road was steep perfect for gaining speed to ensure a fatal crash without thinking too much i would just talk myself out and not commit i pulled a uturn and drove to the hill which was about 5 minutes after that point they say your life flashes before your eyes mine played back to me for those 5 minutes the most important people and influential moments of my life appeared before my eyes they suddenly disappeared as i approached my chosen hill my foot automatically floored the gas pedal i placed my left foot behind the brake so i wouldnt back out i raced down the hill gaining more and more speed by the time i reached the bottom my car which only has a speedometer for up to 200 kmh i saw the road start to bend and i jerked my wheel into the opposite direction of the turn slamming the front end of the car into the median that was the last thing i remembered before waking up in my car with tapping on the window from bystanders all i could think to myself at that moment was wow i so much of a failure i cant even kill myself a bystander described to the paramedics and police that i hit the median did about 10 spins no flips and then continued to scrape median down the hill for another 250m i got a glimpse of my car before i was taken away in an ambulance it was completely destroyed when i arrived to the hospital i was placed in the trauma room however the doctor was incredibly surprised after seeing me sitting upright with consciousness after a 200 kmh car accident he assessed me and ordered a fullbody ct scan the results came back clean no bleeding no broken bones and most importantly no death he then admitted me to the psychiatry ward which i wont get into on this post but it was a nightmare the everyones surprise i was barely injured walking away with a concussion with memory loss at most this phrase really stuck in my mind because nearly every person i have talked to so far has said its a miracle youre alive im not religious but i agree it is a miracle im alive and im not going to waste it im begging for help because i know this community loves to help people when they reach out i really want to try and beat my depression but i dont know how i have tried cbt im going back to ect for another round of treatment and im on increased medication i will be seeing counsellors and psychiatrists however thanks to canadian healthcare not until 2020 which is one of the reasons i decided to end it due to lack of resources if anyone out there has any tips on how to manage severe depression and anxiety please let me know im still alive today despite the severity of the crash and i believe its a sign that i need to conquer this depression and do something great with my life i am tired of laying at home with no

being in nature reduces stress and blood pressure but crucially also stops us ruminating on the past and future spending time in nature makes a huge difference to our mental health research has shown it can decrease our stress levels reduce our heart rate and reduce our blood pressure but one of the most interesting effects it has is to reduce how much we ruminate how much we attach ourselves to our thoughts when we get swept away by our thoughts and lose touch with the present moment suffering isnt far behind being lost in the past and future drives a great deal of our sadness and anxiety where nature is incredibly powerful is in its ability to focus our attention taking us out of our heads and into our surroundings via our senses and aside from all that it takes us away from the information bombardment for a little while away from our work and our phone and the tv so when we give our full attention to a bird thats landed on a tree or take the time to look at the different parts of a flower were giving a minds a break and bringing ourselves back to the only place we can be happy here and now listen on apple podcasts listen on google podcasts listen on spotify other ways to listen,1

i was 30 pounds overweight overly stressed and my body was responding in the forms of chronic pain and nausea i was coming apart at the seams and was on my own way to the emergency room life lessons from the flight attendant tools i use for my selfcare be sure to adjust your own mask before helping others says the average flight attendant we have heard this phrase a dozen times but we feel so weird about the thought of putting ourselves first before our loved one or child why does this feel so selfish and wrong culturally we are expected to be strong and almighty at all times we say things like ill sleep when im dead or i cant slow down because my work wont get done unfortunately we have all felt this way at one point in our lives some of us even feel this all the time let me tell you my story of how i had no choice but to put myself first it all started with these 6 words you have hodgkins lymphomastage four my husband got diagnosed with cancer in december of 2017 at the age of 27 our typical conversations about paying bills and doing laundry seemed insignificant it didnt feel real while all hope was not lost intense stress tears and fear of the unknown filled our lives i was 30 pounds overweight overly stressed and my body was responding in the forms of chronic pain and nausea i was coming apart at the seams and was on my own way to the emergency room however as a mom of an energetic fouryearold i did not have the option to fall apart my little girl could not have both of her parents terminally ill in the hospital this was the beginning of my personal healing story i wanted my life and body back so i took control by putting myself first i began by putting a higher priority on selfcare by fulfilling my nutrition exercise and spiritual needs and i continue to do this to this day what would putting yourself first mean for you would it be that you finally have a reason and gain the perseverance to put your selfcare priorities above all others would it mean that you would use nutrition and exercise to fit into that outfit for the wedding you were invited to would it mean that you could take the stressful guesswork out of your healthy meal planning by having a system in place for dinner on those busy nights full of afterschool activities again this idea of putting yourself first is not new think back to the mundane instructions from the flight attendant my challenge for you find one way to put yourself first this week and dont feel guilty about it schedule a 1520 minute guided meditation session for yourself check this one out on soundcloud i also use the app insight timer for some amazing free meditations or tell your spouse to watch the kids for an evening and schedule a one hour massage at a local spa this is my favorite or be rebellious and take a day off work to stay at home and recharge busy yet balanced,1

how do yall deal when depressive episode hits its happening again i have been doing good for a month working on myself i dont wanna get sucked into darkness again help,1
a burden no one wants to spend time with a negative person no one makes time for someone who is having a hard time no one wants to hear bad things complains issues that others are struggling with none of this is fun so no one truly cares no one puts the effort into a relationship whether is a friendship or more most people are selfish and thats ok people dont own people everyone deals with things and thats ok so im giving up asking for help i dont want to bother anyone anymore i dont want to upset others waste their time im just a nobody a burden who doesnt deserve anything im not even sure why im writing this probably because ive isolated myself completely and i guess subconsciously i might appeal to this as a last attempt at admitting i desperately need help im ignoring loved ones messages from friends everyone and i dont even understand why all i know is that i had enough of feeling lonely enough of this unbearable pain enough of hurting myself because i cant take it anymore,1

update im probably getting back together with my old girlfriend from middle school tomorrow night and i havent been this happy in years spoiler alert she kissed me i am over the moon heres the situation if you didnt see the first post alright so a few nights ago i invited my old girlfriend from middle school to come over to my place and watch movies weve been hanging out for the last few months getting to know eachother again and im so so happy ive been considering seeing if she wanted to start dating again for months and i finally decided that i was just going to do it and see what happened i have a friend who i got to do some recon for me and he was 100 sure that she was just waiting for me to make a move so i wasnt nervous about her saying no or anything i was just hesitating because getting into a relationship with someone you really like is nervewracking and also probably because ive got some horrible problems with intimacy dab anyway my roommate was home so we spent some time playing board games together which was awesome but after a bit i texted her like hey need to hang out with this lady alone for a bit please let me have the living room and so she did and it was just her and me i made dinner which was awful because im not a great cook and i meant for us to go out to eat somewhere but we both bike places so that wasnt realistic so we had a meal of very salty stir fry which she somehow managed to eat without complaining one time while we were eating we put on a movie we started the night on opposite sides of the couch but i being the subtle and suave woman of the world that i am got just a little bit closer to her every time i got up to refill my water which was a lot until eventually she called me out and said that i could just sit next to her if i wanted which i did so i did and i sort of nestled into the crook of her arm and she put her arm around me and i rested my head against her shoulder gonna be honest folks coulda cried its the most right ive felt in years probably the most right ive felt in oh something like eight years and three months since she moved away the first time it was like putting on glasses for the first time when you didnt know how bad your eyesight had gotten i didnt realize how much happiness i hadnt been feeling just being close to her like that again was such a rush but a weirdly calm rush like after youve been running for a long time and you finally get to flop down in the grass somewhere i felt so much stress that id been holding on for years just melt gone and i didnt even worry about what i was doing or if i was going too fast or if i looked stupid or anything like that i didnt worry about her thinking it was weird that my hand was on her stomach or if i was being too affectionate i was able to just stop thinking and enjoy the moment feeling her breathing how soft her shirt was how great it felt to have someone hold me for the first time in ages and i was so relaxed and so content that the words just slipped out we should go out again didnt fret about how i was going to phrase it or what she would think or how it would affect our friendship just said it and she didnt say yes she fucking kissed me she put her hand on my cheek and leaned down and put her lips on my lips and she kissed me i wish i could say it was my first kiss because the other ones were really regrettable but it was my first kiss with her i remember how often i would stress about wanting to kiss her when we were alone together drawing comics in my room or watching tv or doing homework or whatever and i never did it and i always regretted not doing it and now weve done it and it was beautiful and fantastic and im gonna scream i cant stop thinking about her im smiling all the time my friends dont recognize me when im not miserable every little thing about her just makes me grin like a loon she called me by the silly pet name that she had for me in middle school i didnt know how much i missed that and she held my hand she kissed me at the door ahhh we get to hold hands in public and i can introduce her to people as my partner and we dont have to hide that were dating anymore because were adults and who cares what anyone thinks i dont remember the last time i was giddy like this and of course im also terrified because ive spent a long time in therapy trying to learn how to be vulnerable with people and silence my brain when it says that my best friends are going to get shipped off to mexico at any moment so getting close to people is dangerous and ive been trying to learn how to develop feelings for other people since i obviously couldnt have a relationship with her because she was in yucatan for all i knew it feels regressive to date her again when ive made so much progress trying to get over losing her and i worry that im romanticizing her i dont think i am at least not too badly but theres always the voice in the back of my head telling me that i only love this person because she used to be my middle school girlfriend were both totally different people now and im worried that my brain is just settling into this relationship because i want those eight years back with the girl i knew and i want her parents to like me i mean they do like me but i want them to like me as her girlfriend i want them to approve of me as a partner apparently shes out to her dad which surprises me a little but he always seemed like he might be cool her mom still doesnt know shes very religious but my girlfriend ahhhh says that shes trying to get better about lgbt stuff since pope francis is cool with it so maybe theres a chance anyway im dying over here thank you to everyone who wanted an update on this story if anybody just wants to hear me gush some more feel free to reach out via dms my profile is a kinky mess alt account for lonely nights so please ignore any nsfw stuff you see i have so much stuff that i want to talk about and my friends are all tired of hearing about it although theyre happy that theres an update and that things are going well so dont hesitate to reach out,0

ive read that we arent aware of 90 of what is going on around us in terms of energy electromagnetic fields vibrations spirits angels brainwaves wavelengths frequencies and ect personally i believe in this especially because ive experienced a lot of events that many would consider weird hallucinations paranormal and spiritual for example i went to bed to my girlfriend who just had fallen asleep a couple of minutes earlier and right after laying down i saw this glowing green orb exiting her body coming in front of me as if it was looking at me and then reversing outside my bedroom window im 100 sure it was her spiritlight body or whatever you wanna call it one time i was meditating buddha style with my eyes halfway closed and saw this huge glowing golden orb approach me nowadays while thinking or talking to someone i get to see these shining small orbs appear out of nowhere and stay there for a while all varying in different colours nowadays i mostly see blue all of this has been happening to me since 2013 when ive started meditating and getting really into spirituality if you are interested ive made this youtube video about which method of meditation opened my awareness to be able to witness these sightings let me know your thoughts on it,0
if you guys have been experiencing this probably best to tell someone about it ive been under tremendous stress lately with work my car which i fucked up backing out of my driveway and my relationship and lately ive been having more and more nasty thoughts that arent really normal for me to have i consider myself a down to earth dude with a lot of good hobbies and friends that keep my mind occupied but the amount of stress ive been having has changed the way i think and behave in public for example i have been socially checked out for the past couple of months something that people have been pointing out to me recently its caused me to lose track of my schedule and ive gone back into having recurring episodes of severe depression and im smoking cigarrettes on the dl also not normal of me worst of it all has been my thoughts where i would randomly without any provocation think about the most fucked up things i could do to someone or something i think its important to note these things because i feel like im not the only one in this position either and as a person that struggles with mental health i know its important to at least put your thoughts on text no matter how embarrassing ill list a few specific examples of what some of these thoughts have been i was driving down a freeway and thought about running off a bridge at 65 mph as well as running over pedestrians on the sidewalk without any feelings i thought about shmacking my grandmas head with a frying pan for no fucking reason i was on the line about deciding whether or not to push my friend into a lake when i know he cant swim well those are just a few of those thoughts but i love my family and friends and would absolutely never voluntarily put anyone in danger i dont exactly know if these thoughts are a byproduct of my stress levels or if im a straight psycopath again i really want to reiterate that i am a good person and its super abnormal for me to think something as horrific as what i described if you also have these thoughts you should dm me or even comment bc no matter how embarrassing its honestly relieving my stress right now just typing this out thanks for understanding im going to post this elsewhere as well to hopefully help more people too,1

work related stress is ruining my life i work as a manager in retail for background im only 21 ive had anxiety all my life and i was also diagnosed with bipolar depression last year im also a college dropout ive worked seasonally at this job in 2017 then came back again in 2018 they decided to keep me and eventually i worked my way up to a manager position earlier this year at the beginning i did enjoy working here and helping people out but i have been recently feeling extremely stressed and burnt out from work as a manager i have a long list of tasks to do everyday while managing others and dealing with customers i would say im a hard worker and getting tasks done is normally doable for me the thing that gets me is having to deal with people especially as i am an introvert and work full time so i have little time to recharge and with the holidays coming customers are very aggressive and it triggers my fight or flight instincts i get frustrated when people come up to me to ask a question as it is disrupting my tasks i need to get done which i feel really bad about it just feels like an instinct reaction to me thats hard for me to control in the past few weeks i think the stress has become enough for me ive had multiple people threaten to call corporate about me for me simply following the rules one of those people actually did call corporate about me and lied about the situation i had a woman come up to me acting passive aggressive towards me my anxiety normally shows itself as anger or frustration which has become difficult to hide and put on a front for others to see got a complaint to my boss from her about me and how i didnt say youre welcome for showing her where something was on top of that we have another manager who has been causing issues as well as forcing me and others to have to alter our hoursschedule the final straw for me was today when i got yelled at by my district manager for not completing something i tried to hold my tears back but towards the end i couldnt hide my shaky voice she confronted me about it and i broke down what really pissed me off is i know she doesnt care about my stress she seemed more worried that there was now a crying manager its just a bunch of little encounters that nag at me when i try to sleep at night they build up and i just exploded today i already know that i want to leave this job but i really like my store manager and i would feel bad for quitting when were about to hit peak season the pay is also good and im trying to save money to move out but the stress seeps into my personal life and im isolating myself and neglecting my life aspirations i want to be an artist but in order to work my way there i need to be creating but by the time im off work im exhausted mentally and physically ive become pessimistic and cynical again i feel hopeless that if i dont make a change soon i will be stuck in customer service forever which makes me feel suicidal ive been looking for other jobs but nothing seems like it would be better also when i get complaints i reflect on it for days and think about myself as a person and how people see me i feel terrible for not being more welcoming and friendly like i used to be but at the same time im angry at the customers for being rude to me when it comes to my mental health i was in therapy when i started the job but left in the beginning of the year because i was doing well i decided i am going to go back to therapy to deal with my anger and stress but now i feel my anxiety and mood swings coming back i worry that all of the stress will trigger a depressive episode which for me is debilitating the stress has also triggered mania for me before i just feel like i cannot be a manager anymore and i want to leave the customer service industry forever im just scared to do something about it i know this post was long but its been a rough month for me i dont want to bother my friends about my problems but i just needed a place to rant until i can get a therapy appointment i also wanted to hear if anyone else has experienced this stress and burnout from work and how they handled it ive been hysterically crying all night and i just cant take it anymore,1
chronic stress relief please help hi i am writing this post because i am to be blunt very desperate for stress relief i am only 19 but about half of my life has been spent trying to cope with things that were abnormally stressful in comparison to my peers my parents getting divorced in 5th grade quickly turned into my mother being emotionally abusive my new stepdad making my moms house very unsafe and my mom taking his side and doing very out of pocket things to try to get us to pity her pretending to be stalked faking cancer allegedly being poisoned etc ever since this began i had always followed an escapist route so much so like that i developed a form of psychosis that led me to believe that this world was entirely a dream and that i had more control over things than i actually do i have undergone a lot of persona mental illness related troubles as well and it truly seems as if there is no situational stress relief in february of 2020 however things took a turn for the worse due to extenuating circumstances i was facing an incredible amount of financial stress and had to scrounge for money to buy dinner i started experiencing debilitating stomach pain that doctors could not pinpoint quarantine followed shortly thereafter and then i moved 2 hours away from everyoneeverything in order to go to college i had no money and no friends and my grades began to slip my stomach pains got worse and then i also started to experience sleep issues that make it virtually impossible to wake up on time for work class etc unless i have slept 12 hours i have seen so many specialists to no avail and these health issues simply exacerbate all of the other familial academic and financial burdens i am facing i have been trying to be as patient as i can but i have now been told that the majority of my health issues are caused by stress itself this is a catch22 in many ways and this news in and of itself is a stressor now i am hyperaware of my stress and feel like i cant do anything without getting chest pains i am getting a new psychiatrist and therapist but my appointments are not for a while but i am not functional until then i do things to destress daily art talking to my familyboyfriend etc but its clearly not enough any help is appreciated thanks,1

do you ever wish you were alone i have a girlfriend of 5 years and i feel so guilty for wasting so much of her time on me i feel like it would have been better if i was alone so i could just end it but now i have to keep going just to make sure she has a good life i can deal with my eventual death but knowing that i will have to watch all of my loved ones wither away and die even if its on a 2550 year scale is too much every moment is a moment closer to tragedy the easy solution would be to die young but then im leaving behind my gf and i wouldnt wish that on her i feel like that expression watching a car crash in slow motion thats life its all just a slow painful build up to eventual tragedy not sure if this is very coherent but it feels really good to put it out there,1
first time going for therapy and my therapist cried recently ive been feeling dangerously numb again and im just very exhausted ive lived 22 years feeling like im dead and if i dont get help now i will probably be dead in my 30s it was last friday i was very nervous because i felt some sort of shame for making this person listen to me talk about my childhood for 2 hours i felt selfish inside i kept thinking okay what should i talk about next and it was almost as though i was selecting a book off a shelf to read aloud to this lady opposite me and these are books youve written and read countless times before and reading it one more time feels like nothing to you but then she started crying before we had started she placed a tissue box next to me and said that i might need it but in a reversal of events im the one panicking she said that the image of child me living in constant emotional abuse and neglect for almost 18 years broke her heart after i went home i cried too ive forgotten that i shouldnt be used to it and that it is okay for me to cry to feel sorrow for the child who was once me that i dont have to play it off as the past or compartmentalize my feelings that i am still very haunted even as an adult,1

sudden stutter hi guys i have recently started a job in december that is a lot more overwhelming than first anticipated its not the job description that is the problem its the place and the boss there is basically 3 years worth of mess for me to clean up as a result of this i havent been sleeping well for the last 3 months and i think its finally caught up with me this morning because i woke up the morning stumbling over my words and stuttering over others any advice to bring me back from the edge of what might be a stress induced full freakout tia,1
if isolation is bad why does it feel so good why do i feel even more inhuman when im with others i dont want to talk i dont want to smile i dont want one of my friends to listen im sick and tired of speaking of explaining whenever im alone i might have moments of sadness but i also moments of joy when im with others i forget what my thoughts are really about and it feels like i am caught to spend time with them i dont want people to occupy me or make me happy i just want to be how i am angry sad tired and just deal with my own thoughts without having to tell people how i feel and why i feel that way i dont even want help because everytime someone tries to help it feels like they are forcing me into a certain behaviour that i dont want its not that i see my depression as a disease or illness i see it as a symptom for something deeper for the fact that i simply dont want to be part of this society be normal hang around with others meeting friends feels so pointless so shallow like you are still suffering but you forget it for a few moments i dont want to forget because i actually think the suffering might wanna tell me something if your leg hurts because you broke it you dont just swallow pills or hang around others and everything will be fine you have to see whats wrong and adjust it and right now every form of human interaction feels like im doing a marathon with that leg,1

has anyone else went to see a therapist to get help from their severe depression but once you get there your mind is so hazy and forgetful that it makes it extremely difficult to explain your experience i found that a lot of times in the past i would be rushed out the office with crappy advice that i was already trying to do and then i panic and try to desperately get everything out by the end of the session its hard to open up about it when im having an episode because the symptoms of pure confusion difficulty thinking and focusing memory loss and just plain blankness of mind makes everything so frustrating for not from depression sorry,1
after months of searching i finally found a job also they wanted me so bad i felt comfortable negotiating my salary they didnt even low ball me it was just that i recognized that i got a call 3 hours after i applied and only me and one other person made it to the second round of interviews also i overheard that the other person messed up their in person interview time and had to reschedule i knew they needed me and i didnt let on that i needed them so i was able to negotiate 10 more i feel very proud of myself and its the first time i feel happy about life in many many months,0

mind racing f24 hi ive been dealing with mental health issues since i was 14 after my father had passed away and things were always pretty rocky my mother also passed away in january of 2020 to cancer ive been dealing deeply with horrible negative thoughts that just wont go away its been eating me alive for sometime now i feel super alone especially with how life is new trends albums shows and ive always just been in my own lonely world to really be apart of it i cant talk with anyone because i just dont be in it i also been alone with finding something to do because ill get bored of it quick or just get easily distracted i hope someone understands this my mind is all over the place so its hard to explain myself sometimes i havent been happy in a long time i havent had a good laugh in years im getting tired of my mind and how it controls my life so much im getting to the point of wanting to give up,1
what do i feel in my chest when i get stressedanxious when i get a surge of stress i feel something in my chest its like a wave of tension its not pain its weird its a little bit of vibration too what is this,1
i think acting depressed around people was a mistake no one gives a shit lmao unless you have a very special person whos very close to you whoever notices youre acting off will not want to help because youre not fun to be around and in the end youll just lose connections truth is youre way better off if you force a smile on your face if i had known this before i feel like i might have had more and better relations with people that i would have liked dont get me wrong i think its important for people to talk about their depression and be true to themselves but its just simply futile to mope around depressed around your peers since thats just gonna insure that no ones ever gonna talk to you its a terrible alternative so give in if you want to help yourself edit okay i was wrong i really should not have gotten this many upvotes i know no one is gonna see this since im editing after like a month but i was wrong talking to people helps so so much its just you gotta find the right people or you gotta build a friendship with someone to eventually be able to talk about your depression its true that forcing a smile on your face will probably help you to build these kind of friendships and its true its not a good idea express your depression to randoms just like that but i just want to say dont bottle up your feelings forever do what you must to create friendships with people that enable you to do this often forcing a smile helps for this but dont do this forever,1

why do people assume that our lives arent that bad as long as were alive i had a conversation with my granddad yesterday and i basically told him how stressed and down i was feeling he said i shouldnt let anything take my joy away but i told him my joy was long gone he then proceeded to tell me that life cant be that bad i felt so invalidated its like as soon as you open up a little you get slammed with how hard other people have it and how you should be grateful i understand there are people out there that have it worse than me but does that mean im not allowed to be depressed or anxious can i not express how i feel without someone throwing in a counterargument about another persons struggle its like people assume everything is perfect as long as youre alive they only see what they want to see and arent comfortable with the ugly truth im so sorry for rambling but this really pisses me off,1
today im finally throwing away my suicide note ive been a better state of mind this past year but i think this is the day that i finally commit to it im not going back again i made the changes that got me here after almost a decade of misery and i can do it again if i end up back where i was i hope if you read this and are suffering yourself that you see this as evidence that no matter how long youve felt this way recovery is always a possibility much love x,0

the most stress ive had ever im studying for a test to get in a university its been really stressing me out so much that something as simple as moving around can be somewhat entertaining but recently in a try out test i cant even finish 50 of it even tho ive studied almost all day everyday my stress level went up so much that i started to cry i cant even remember the last time i cried so its that bad and everytime i tried to take a break i always felt guilty because i know i only have around 3 months left to study but i decided to just chill around excercising usually works for me but it doesnt for this any help,1

today ive decided to elimate my biggest stress factor my daytime fulltime job i decided not to show up im not going back i worked there for 3 years and ive always felt like a soulless being once i entered the job i was making 17 an hour at this place 40 hours a week 500 after tax for now ill be doing ubereats making 20 an hour i will be my own boss and work my own time temporarily i know they will be pissed because im the only one at this place including the manager that does what i do but when they presented me a 50 cent raise i screamed inside i finally broke free and i feel a little bad about my decision today but in the long run i know my mental state will be in a better position i can finally drive my wife to work and drop off our daughters in school and in the afternoon pick my daughters up and then pick my wife up this brings me joy i know how hard it is for my wife to dress two kids in the morning take public transportation when its really really cold raining snowing outside thats really hard i pray everything goes well from here on,0
is not sure whats happening so im not really here to use this as a diagnosis this is more so for me to see if this is genuine enough to seek help or just to generally get an idea of whats wrong im not sure that it can be classified as depression but i didnt really know where else to go sometimes i really worry alot that maybe im subconsciously doing this for attention or something like that or im just being dramatic and not knowing it to start off though whenever im feeling fine im a pretty motivated person i really like to work out and box its one fo my favorite things to do im in college and i get pretty good grades i love to explore and try new things im a big foodie maybe even to the point i eat way more than i should haha however i have periods of time where i just feel very very unhappy and unsatisfied with everything i can usually tell when its about to start it begins with me kind of zoning out alot more and ill start to have times where i question existence and everything seems kinda fake these times kind of suck because i start to feel like everything im doing is pointless and i just want to drop out and leave then i start to get extremepy irritable im pretty much mad at everything and ill even make stupid arguments with my gf and look for reasons to be angry this is then followed by a period where im just unhappy i guess im not sure if thats the right word im not necessarily sad all the time although im much more likely to be sad but its mostly just i dont want to exist i guess like its so hard to just do anything and it kind of puts a strain on my relationship because i dont want to talk or go anywhere or even cuddle with my girlfriend everything i try to do is just unsatisfying i cant even sit on tik tok or play games i just want to do absolutely nothing and be alone and it makes me genuinely so sad when my girlfriend wants me to get out of bed during good periods the unhappiness will only last a few days during bad times it can last a week or two the zoning out and irritability will usually start 13 weeks before depending on how bad it is its all a slow build up then it slowly goes away this all happens kind of randomly maybe once every other month during the summer it gets much worse during the winter it lasts longer and is much more intense i really just want to know if this is genuine or not im really unsure sometimes,1
witness to extreme violence today i saw a 23 yo being thrown away from a moving car into the highway i arrived a bit late to the scene while she was bleeding a bit and had a shock response where she could not stop shaking and crying then she told me her name and that was her husband who pushed her from the car when the police arrived they were so violent with her specially the oldest guy who lacked basic human empathy he blamed her and she stopped talking and came back to cry uncontrollably my husband and i checked for visible injuries and confort her while we could it happened on a 5 pm sunday while we were going for groceries and now i cant shake the memory and have no idea what to do with what i witnessed,0

struggling ive delt with depression for alot of my life i lost my mom to cancer a month after i turned 21 in 2010 and spent most of my 20s in a dark place never really processing it in a healthy way fast forward to 2017 and thats when i hit an all time low becoming suicidal and hating the fact i would wake up and see another day that became a real turning point for me i decided i really needed to get my life in order over the past few years thats exactly what i did i quit a job i hated and got my dream jobstarted chasing a hobby i have loved since i was 9 but was too scared to ever try lost over 40pounds got myself outta debt and started a real savings account everything seemed and felt like i finally got my life on track and was heading into a great direction as i turned 30 i was becoming more social and really breaking outta my shell then covid hit and everything started to fall apart i lost my dad to cancerdementia last december ten years almost to the day that i lost my mom a month later i got covid and it took a horrible toll on me this past january in march i found out my dream job would be shutting down in may that job ment alot as i met alot of special people who helped me become a better person saying goodbye to them sent me down a bad spiral of weed and junk food where i ended up putting on 20pounds my hobby has been on hold since covid started as its a contact activity i was actually getting pretty good at it too precovidive gone through a good chunk of my savings as i look for other work and am back in more debt then ive ever been in before ive found myself now not knowing where the past six weeks of my life have gone as ive just been getting high almost everyday im watching everyone around me living what seems to be their best lives wither its exciting new jobs awesome vacations new houses getting married and so on while im laying in bed so broken and numb i havent left the house in over two weeks as getting outta bed feels like it takes everything i have in me i havent posted on social media in months and kinda fallen off the face of the earth what hurts most about that is that is seems and feels like no one has noticed or cares thankfully im not suicidal this time around as ive been before i just feel broken and empty im trying my hardest now to pick myself up and get my life back on track ive given up weed gotten back into the gym and making an extra hard effort to find a job in my career field i know we are all dealing with stuff which is why i dont really tell anyone this as i dont want to be a burden im hoping posting this here will help in some therapeutic way and i know this was a very long read so i dont expect many people to get through the whole thing but if you did thank you i know there will be better days a head i just hope they come soon much love to everyone who is struggling right now i hope you know you are not alone,1

im literally all alone and theres no hope for my future this is going to be extremely long so just a headsup i was abused from 814 years old when my mom married my stepdad my mom was an amazing person and she always did whatever was best for me she had no way of knowing that my stepdad was a horrible person because he was actually really good at hiding it by acting all sweet and kind he would do it in secret when my mom went away on business trips and he psychologically messed me up so much that i was scared to tell my mom just so you know how bad it was ill tell you something he did my precious pup at the time was my best friend and id always go to her for comfort whenever he was abusing me he noticed how much she meant to me so he started grabbing her and beating her infront of me while i pleaded with him to stop he killed her like that one day he just told my mom she ran away or something my mom started becoming suspicious and eventually found out she divorced him and got a restraining order the next 2 years were the happiest years of my life i got a absolutely gorgeous girlfriend that was way out of my league and made some amazing friends i started highschool and things were going great then my mom got sick the nerves in her legs started to rapidly deteriorate or something so she couldnt walk she lost her job and became very depressed she unfortunately ended her own life i broke that day luckily i had my girlfriend and her parents that did everything they could to make sure things were going to be ok for me since i dont have any other family it was always just me and my mom my grandparents died when i was 5 and my dad died when i was 2 so i never really knew him my girlfriends parents let me stay by them and they were willing to pay for my schooling and everything it was hard getting over my moms death but i was able to get through it thanks to my girlfriend for a while things were going ok again but then my friendgroup started experimenting with drugs and my girlfriend wasnt having it so she separated me from them it was against my will but im happy that she did i didnt have any friends but my girlfriend was my best friend anyways and she was more than enough for me once again things were going well for a bit until covid hit and my girlfriends parents started struggling with money i felt really bad since they wouldnt have struggled if it wasnt for me living with them i started eating less and doing everything i could to save them money unfortunately it didnt really help theyre still struggling a bit what im about to tell now is where my whole existence just shattered my girlfriend broke up with me i wont explain why but the reason for it was understandable and ill never hold anything against her like i said before shes way out of my league and she was the most perfect girlfriend anyone could ever dream of while im just an average guy that had issues because of what ive been through and all of the mess that follows me so we broke up and now im all alone i lost the only person that i had in my life and not only that but she was the one that was keeping me together to add insult to injury her parents suddenly just did a complete turnaround and they suddenly dont give a shit about me anymore they want me out of their house by january next year my ex has pleaded with them to be less cruel but i asked her to just leave it cause i dont want to be the reason for them fighting im only 18 and my finals are literally right around the corner i dont have anywhere to go im all alone without a single cent to my name and im trying to get through a break up still i cant begin to explain how i feel i dont care what anyone says about oh but there is help and you can get through this because i literally cant my entire life has been slowly cracking and crumbling and now its finally collapsed im only 18 years old all alone no money no job and soon i wont have anywhere to go ill be homeless everything is out to get me right now and there isnt anything i can do im going to go and kill myself soon the sad part is that even if i do nobody would care life is fucking shit thanks to whoever actually read all of this i guess im just hopelessly trying to leave any kind of legacy behind that i possibly can goodluck to everyone else thats still dealing with life and all its bullshit,1
is this a bad coping mechanism to be short my stress stems from other people being stressed i myself personally have no real issues but this pandemic has made life hard for people i care about and thus causes my stress the biggest one is a friend of mine who because of the pandemic and her health issuesweak immune system she has been unable to consistently keep a job this year i help her as best i can driving her to workinterviews she has no car lending her money which i know wont be repaid anytime soonthrough no fault of hers and has depleted my savings account she also has depression and because of all of this has been having more and more low days her roommate also has depression and recently it culminated in him having a breakdown on a bad day and pulling out his gun wanting to end it all thankfully we called his best friend and sister and they convinced him to go to a doctor and get help but i know this just compounds my friends anxiety about being a burden on him because she herself has been unable to pay rent the past few months note he has a very good paying job and doesnt necessarily need her rent he mostly wanted a roommate for the company but its still a source of great guilt and shame for her she just found out today that her seasonal job decided not to keep her on and she has to hunt for another job again and it makes me worried about her even though she seems level headed about it right now and i dont feel like she is a huge risk right now but i know i still need to keep an eye on her and check in the coping mechanism perhaps this was triggered by her roommates breakdown but through part of the day ive just been running the scenario through my mind what if she does kill herself i run it through my head how i might act or feel who i would call what life might be like for me afterwards and feel the emotions of the imagined scenario wash over me even as i think about it from a practical standpoint the reason i call this a coping mechanism is because this isnt the first time ive done this almost everyone i knowam close to has depression and is on meds one of these friends i drove to the hospital after her suicide attempt a few years ago a different friend and i was her crutch at the time like i am for this friend almost all of my depressed friends ive run through the horrible scenario in my head and had the thoughts of what would i do how would this effect my life physically and emotionally i do my best to be available for my friend while trying to keep my own mental health in check even though i feel guilty when i say i cant hang out with herdont have the spoons to drive to her place as she lives 30 minutes away and while im helping her financially i know i cant keep doing it but i try to help her when she needs rides or small things but other than that theres not much else i can do to help her its all been horrendous bad luck out of our control i know this thought process probably isnt normal but could it just be this weird coping mechanism im doing to try and assert some sort of control of the situation or am i a complete sociopath for running the scenarios in my head,1
does anyone else feel like their life has been irreversibly destroyed by mental illness i sure as fuck do i dont know what to do at this point suicide sounds like a very convenient option at the moment but i just dont know how i would go through with it i mean whats the point of living if you have to spend a substantial part of your life battling inner demons its exhausting and i feel mentally crippled this has been going on for about a decade with no signs of any quantifiable progress or improvement what the fuck is the point,1

i have made the decision to give up until i kill myself i have never been happy my parents have always put themselves over me they dont keep jobs theyre addicts and have never ever done something for me unless it benefitted them i remember being a 6 year old not understanding why my dad wouldnt just give me food why did i have to tell him my moms secrets or do something for him to be fed why couldnt my parents just go to the store and get me advil when i am in pain why did i have to wait for them to run out of beer and then they might get it if they remembered why did i sleep on chairs because every time i asked for a mattress they were too busy i was friends with a girl when i was very young she passed away and my mom didnt even take me to the funeral i self harmed at 12 and my mom looked at me and walked away my dad used to emotionally abuse me at the same time one day on christmas when there werent presents under the tree i asked my mom why and she screamed and i mean screamed at like 2nd grade me about how santa isnt real because we were poor and so many other things that have just chipped away at me over time i overthink to such an extreme degree i dont think i could grow up and stay sane i have so many thoughts that race through my head that my veins feel like they are physically heating up and i want to scratch my skin off im 16 i barely mentioned anything ive been through and im 16 i say that because to me 16 is a fucking child i am a child and i mentally feel 60 i feel like ive gone through so much had to raise myself at such a young age overthought the universe and self analyzed myself to all shit and it all has just burned me the fuck out i dropped out because i knew my parents wouldnt care i finally have reached a point where i am so tired i cant even try to care i dont think ill ever get out of this burnout theres nothing to look forward to theres nothing that motivates me being a kid is the best part of life and then you grow up and work and suffer except all ive done is suffer and now ive given up i dont think or want to get a steady job to work for the next 40 years of my life just to benefit a corrupt fucking system i think about the future and i dont see one for myself and honestly thats what i want if i feel this way at 16 i dont want to grow older i dont want to have future plans i want to fuck around and then kill myself because theres truly no place in this world where i would be happy call me lazy and selfish but this life is so fucking stupid we come here to suffer and work some get to suffer less and some get to suffer more and why you may ask there is no why were on a rock suffering doing all this labor and we dont even know why were here or why were doing it we follow these governments and do what they say because what else can we do we live paycheck to paycheck with only a couple days off and then back to being a slave i dont really have an idea for what happens in the afterlife but i genuinely do not care anymore i dont because this life im living now leaves a rotten taste in my mouth and i cant fucking stand it thats all,1

does my depressed girlfriend realize rather than feel that she loves me hi everyone my 31m girlfriend 28f of 4 years suffers from depression and shes currently going through a rough period i have never understood depression and i have accepted that i never will so i just try to be as supportive as i can with information from places like this subreddit however one question that ive always had and was afraid to ask why cant she own up to it she is currently going through tough times these days she does not feel love for me or anyone else and is completely miserable this is something that i can accept as being depression but why cant she just say something like i know that i love you even though i dont feel it or thank you for taking care of me i know this must suck for you she could even say i know i dont feel grateful right now but rationally i realize that you are amazing for taking care of me one small sentence like that would mean the world to me and i cant imagine that she does not realize this i hope this post wont be interpreted the wrong way she is struggling with something horrible and i am complaining about wanting some compliments on the internet but some days i feel like i cant take this anymore thank you to anyone who reads this edit a few hours after posting this with a throwaway account she texted me a heart no explanation no words shes still unresponsive in her bed this is the absolute highlight of my week,0

time for another round of do i actually feel sick or is it just psychosomatic i generally feel unconcerned with the coronavirus thing if you think you have it quarantine yourself stay clean but if you get it its not the end of the world assuming youre healthy and have no preexisting conditions just rest and get better i tend to have little issues related to things other than illness aches and pains from my job nausea that happens for no real reason from time to time anxiety from depression and stress etc and i would like to think that if this whole virus thing with inconsistent symptoms it seems health sites say one thing individual people say well actually wasnt happening i wouldnt be stressing over what ifs as much are these little its nothings actually something is what ive been wondering more for example im not constantly sneezing or have a runny nose like a cold but i have been sneezing just a bit more often my throat isnt sore though it does get itchy or scratchy out of nowhere and if i cough its to relieve the feeling in my throat not a cough that comes from the lungs if that makes sense so allergies right but ive also been getting chest pain and having more issues breathing not constantly just out of nowhere itll start and stop at some point ok chest pain could be stress andor anxiety because i have a lot of that in my life oh and ive also been getting headaches lately which isnt normal for me but i had been chalking it up to stress since it came before everything else my mom was away for a week and a half visiting a friend and i basically had to pick up some responsibilities like going to the store driving people places making sure regular things were done like the garbage being taken out all things that sound easy but are stressful and frustrating when it feels like youre the only one doing it so stress causing the chest pain and headaches and i figured that allergies could be causing the trouble breathing its happened before usually in the spring im not sure what im allergic to but its definitely something in the air during the warmer weather and it has been starting to get warmer plus as far as i know i havent had a fever i have been getting the chills lately but thats also common when im overtired which can be from stress but then theres the doubts especially after i hear that the symptoms arent definitely this this and this like one of the things emphasized is the difficulty breathing but ive seen a post from one confirmed case that said they only had that symptom when they tried to smoke so under certain circumstances i also thought you had to have coldlike symptoms but apparently not this virus is one that you apparently need a bingo chart to mark your symptoms and so im just conflicted am i just plagued by stress causing me to have mild explainedaway symptoms or is there a chance that its really something im not worried about dying if i do have it i ordered some pure vitamin c though at the behest of my one sister very holistic linked me to a site where i can get it without anything else added in revitalizewellnessorg if anyone is interested she says it treats it or something and gave me a dosage chart im just very tired of this whole situation i guess my other sister is pretty convinced she has it and has stayed home from work the last 2 days she said she doesnt feel well and while im not sure that hers isnt also mental since shes been freaking out since the start not my life womanshrugginglightskintone and since im in regular contact with her because we live in the same house well it also adds to that what if mentality what if anyone else feel similar or am i just crazy and overly stressed,1

the incidents of my childhood which makes it worse for me one of the first memories i have about 35 years my father went after my mother with a knife and even stabbed through a door with a knife he was then thrown out by my grandparents and i saw him only once a short time later he was an alcoholic all his life and did not even try to contact me even when my exwife met him by chance in the hospital 10 years ago and gave him my cell phone number without my knowledge in the meantime he passed away about 2 months ago and i knew nothing about him except that he was an alcoholic after he was no longer there my mother had quickly met someone new my stepfather he was 8 years younger than my mother unfortunately he was also very aggressive as a chain smoker he was very quickly annoyed when he had no more cigarettes and has quickly become with things around him it also did not take long and my mother and he have often and loudly quarreled often thrown on dishes on the walls he became unfortunately also now and then handgreiflich and has beaten me and my brother whereby my brother was rather his favorite since he was older and could make more with him after we have moved several times we lived in a townhouse only then it did not take long that my mother and my stepfather have also divorced my stepfather had cheated on my mother for a long time with my cousin yes it does not get better after the separation my stepfather has emptied the joint account and has filed for bankruptcy because no one could keep the house alone my mother also had to file for bankruptcy shortly after that we moved of course unfortunately my mother lost her job 3 years later and has never found a fulltime job again and lives since then on social benefits with my brother child of my first husband and 3 years older than me i never had a really good relationship mostly he didnt want to have anything to do with me and we generally did less together he was also not at the same school as me he was never very educated unfortunately he also moved out quite early because he did not get along with our mother at all and even resented that she separated from our stepfather because he got along with him he then moved to another cousin of ours until he was 18 and even had contact with our stepfather generally he was always very strange he watched our parents having sex or generally our mother taking a shower and played with himself while doing so he is also said to have had sex with our cousin according to a friend of his probably several times and has often set fire with a friend together he somehow had a kind of mother complex and for many years always looked for much older women who often also had children but usually it did not last very long when it was over he often set a fire somewhere what i knew about afterwards was his own car a garden shed a meadow and finally an attic of an apartment building whereupon he was arrested and sentenced however only on probation his last partner was 11 years older than him with whom he actually held out for 6 years only a short time later he had a partner 11 years younger a complete change of heart which was then suddenly pregnant immediately after the first child a few weeks later she was pregnant again however i had in the people 10 years very very rarely contact with my brother and we have seen us actually only when our grandparents died who have reached a proud age 92 and 94 in general i have also completely broken off contact in the meantime because after several attempts on my part no normal relationship can develop between us i can not even have a reasonable conversation with him because you just notice he seems to be very stupid i just can not express it differently about me i also made a lot of mistakes in life unfortunately for me i almost didnt focus on my schooling and did almost nothing in class my mom didnt care what i did or didnt do anyway she never showed up for a parentteacher conference either i wanted to earn money as fast as possible and learned the next best thing and ended up in the camp my goal though was to become a soldier and joined the army after my training unfortunately i got a slipped disc there and dropped out 2 years later then i ended up in a larger company where i had worked until today i started drinking myself very early 15 years because i myself had a very bad environment the city i lived in generally had high unemployment and there was a lot of drug dealing also through my education i drank almost every day after work and it was later to the point that i completely shut down 4 times a week and had a blackout several times this was no better in the armed forces was able to make the leap in my mid 20s though and quit i dont even drink beer in between anymore because i just dont feel like it i also take my other drugs although i sometimes wonder if maybe i should or smoke either i have always tried in my life to escape into some relationships because i could not be alone my first relationship lasted 5 years circa and i was married myself and had to divorce and have a son my exwife however always wanted to make life difficult for me and i got deeply into debt because of her since she among other things never completed an education just like that she quit her jobs and i was the sole breadwinner and often signed contracts and did not pay them whereupon i received debt collection letters i had to declare insolvency at some point because we also had a joint loan running i had also met a new woman half a year later and moved only my exwife really sabotaged this relationship and it didnt last long also because i wanted to see my son regularly i then decided to stay alone for 2 years but lived near my exwife again because of my son when i met my current partner i decided to finally live my own life and not always be there for others and moved a little further away got another wonderful daughter and everything looked like it was going uphill also this time my exwife has tried to make our life hell which led to the fact that i have quarreled with my partner very often and now also have no contact with my son for a year my job has also deteriorated more and more because the company was bought up 3x and changed the work climate has made me more and more broken and i had a second herniated disc in addition i was then admitted to a day clinic because i was also psychologically at the end after a few months there i was diagnosed with trauma therapy and was also diagnosed with bipolar narcism i discontinued this therapy a year later because it didnt help me at all in the meantime however i have screwed everything up i had to give up my job for health reasons although i have a gdb of 30 and was equalized i am also about to lose my partner because there is more and more crisis between us i really dont have anyone in my life anymore i have moved 13 times in my life in general and have lost a lot of contacts and friends i also lost some contacts because of my exwife i generally only have contact with some friends i met online or old work colleagues i also see my mother about 12 times a year but i dont care if i see her at all or not but she understandably wants contact with her grandchildren i must also say to myself i was a very difficult personality from a certain point and also my friends and partners had to learn to deal with it i always had the urge to somehow talk nonsense and can hardly ever stay serious about anything even when i write this text you could subordinate it under joke addiction or moria i also have a very low frustration threshold and go crazy quickly if i just drop something unfortunately im also very forgetful and often dont know what im supposed to do several times a day i probably owe that to the alcohol all in all due to narcism i often have the impression of being emotionally dead i cry in the rarest situation at all even if sad videos still carry me away i can hardly show empathy towards others i also really dont care about much and i notice it more and more that i really dont care about anything that happens apart from my children i have never really had the feeling of being happy in general almost nothing good has ever happened to me conclusion so now i wonder does it even make sense for me to exist i am insolvent i have a divorce behind me my partner will leave me soon i have no job anymore no friends and probably soon no more apartment since i then the insolvent also no new apartment more find edit first of all thank you all you have really touched my heart even if it is hard for me to admit something like that you dont have to worry about me doing anything to myself i dont want my children to have a horrible childhood like me besides for your love you are really great and i understood that there are things in life worth living for of course i will also seek professional help it is not very easy to get appointments here but i will keep at it and not give up i know i cant change my past but i can change my future my inbox has exploded with messages and i have already replied to some even if i wanted to i probably wont manage to reply to every single one thanks again you are great and stop pls giving me reward save your money smilingface redheart,1
i dont feel like i have any genuine friendships or relationships with anyone anymore i dont know if these are just symptoms of depression but i feel so distant from people that i used to consider friends they never come in contact with me and i cant bring myself to contact them either and when i do its often just short lived conversations or i end up being left on read my main circle of friends kind of broke off and now they never seem to plan anything with me i feel so alone but at the same time it feels so hard to talk to people or even get out and try to meet others as for finding new friendships and relationships i feel like ive met someone but i find it so hard to trust them and i feel so scared all the time that its never going to work out or if theyre even interested i honestly feel like im not even a priority for them but i feel so guilty and selfabsorbed for feeling this way i dont know if i should tell them because it might make me feel clingy i dont know what to do and i feel hopeless edit thank you for gold hopefully our shared experiences can help our fellow brothers sisters and siblings get through these hard times,1

my brother is using his disability against us my brother is 17 and when he gets too stressed his legs can go out but over time he has learned to use that against us he will play on his ps4 all day long and then tell us that he cant do anything because his legs are out he has caused my mom to owe the electric company 1000 dollars because she cant keep up with every month having to pay 200300 dollars we told him to stop playing so much but as soon as we go to sleep hes playing from 11pm3 am even if he already played for 8 hours that day we take the game away and he starts yelling at us about how good we are to take the only thing that can calm him down we have tried to tell him to get out but he says he has nothing to do we give him options and he doesnt want to do it we tell him about all the times he stayed on for hours with a fanheater and laptop all on and he starts arguing about the few days he actually didnt play at all what is the best way to get it into his head that just because hes mad or cant move his legs that doesnt mean its ok for him to waste so much electricity,0
annus horribilus today is the anniversary of my daughters death she died in my arms and i am grateful i could be with her she was 25 and we were very close cut from the same cloth she had long suffered depression and social anxiety which manifested in anorexia and alcoholism creating the perfect storm that resulted in her death she made no secret of her desire to die but her death wasnt suicide per se in the year prior to her passing i was diagnosed with esophegal cancer and spent a lot of time in hospital getting treatment nobody expected me to live and i think this hit my daughter especially hard as she was very emotionally dependent on me during my time in hospital my ex wife my daughters mother came to stay with my daughter to care for her ive since discovered from reading my daughters reddit emails and texts that her mother was drink and abusive the whole time i demanded to be released from hospital early as my daughters health had deteriorated and they made arrangements to get me home i was unable to speak in more than a whisper had no esophegas and was fed through a tube in my stomach but i was happy to be home with my daughter we spent quality time together when she died a few weeks later i arranged the funeral and the wake i couldnt deliver a eulogy or even toast her life my daughter had very few friends partly because of her treatment resistant depression and partly because she just didnt suffer fools lightly but the friends she did have she treated like gold one was hospitalised after a failed suicide attempt and my daughter drove 400 kms to visit him and she went back every day for days on end just as example none of them could manage to get to her funeral i have recovered mostly now but i dont know why i dont want to live especially after this past year i am posting this not out of self pity but as a belated eulogy to my very very special daughter without her the world is black and white and devoid of happiness,1

feeling stressed and anxious about life and it really hurts im a 19yearold girl a senior in college and my existential crisis is getting worse as a kid ive been traumatized by death i remember clearly the day i learned what it was i was maybe 4 or 5 years old in a museum my dad loves visiting them and i always hated going there because it was very silent and spacious giving me the feeling that i had swallowed a bowling ball with a million knots in my stomach the statues looked so real to me i thought they were real people staring at us one of the statues was very intriguing it was a woman on a bed being surrounded by angels i asked my mom what it meant she answered saying its most likely shes dead and the angles help her ascend to heaven and of course i asked whats death and she said its when you leave this world someday and you go to heaven or hell this freaked the hell out of me for so many years mom told me that no one knows when well day it could happen anytime this made of fear the future this nothingness that is death is terrifying to me even heaven seem scary like i always imagine it as a boring white place with nothing going on im more of agnostic very confused about everything i got into counseling to deal with the stress of the uncertain rather than my existential crisis it got better and try my hardest to be excited for the future because theres so much that i want to do and achieve but now its coming back and making me feel like absolute shit because im realizing that im no longer a kid im an adult being taken away from those days i really scared of dying absolutely terrified everything i do now seems meaningless the things i love like makeup and taking care of myself i always feel guilty if i waste my time being on the internet but then if i not doing that i would be reading a book and even that seems unnecessary im afraid of turning old afraid of the future on top of that global warming is making life more anxious i dont want to live at a time where the world might end in such a terrifying way im making my best to help the environment but many dont take that seriously im also afraid of wasting my youth away i have strict parents so i dont get to go out with my friends do things alone and ive never experienced love i know women who are now in their late 30s stuck at their parents house being sad i dont want that i want to move out when i have a job live in another country but with parents like mine strict muslim household theyll refuse and im so scared of doing that that i wont be happy filled with guilt or that it wouldnt work out plus my parents i really love them dont want to leave them but if i stay with them i wont be able to live my life to the fullest so im in a dilemma i have to make a decision somehow because time is running and must not spend my time chickening out but im in a dilemma my head is a mess i feel very hopeless miserable and anxious i feel very lonely would love to be hugged and loved my faculty happens to be only female i dont feel that connected to them and the only friends that i have are far from me one is on another continent and the other isnt in my faculty very busy with work where i am isnt great its a country with many issues and im the only foreigner in my uni the place is quite dangerous you cant go anywhere without a car and we dont have that so im stuck at home with my thoughts to fuck me all over i really miss europe thats where i grew up really hope to move out to somewhere great i just want to be free and happy,1
being feminine in male body so today i was playing games with random people and you know sometime toxic is unavoidable and this the first time i got this comment after long time i never hear it they call me with the most word that i try to forget because bad memory sissy is in another languange suddenly i got triggered and bring back childhood trauma in my head they dont even know me and i became paranoid then i start shivering shakin and scared the braveness that ive been building this time suddenly its more like mask and it shattered i feel i back to my old self here how trauma build in my life when i was elementary school i was so dumb no one even wants to friend with me and if they do they will use me but the most mockery that they call me was because im act like girl they have some nickname for bullied me and its really hard my feelin i dont want even type it even if its not mean at all but there bad meaning there all boys were afraid or disgusted to have same chair as me eventho i wasnt even gay before but still the girl didnt bother to help me they sometime involved to mock me with that nickname but i dont want everyone even girls to hate me so i laugh it off to make them happy it was 6 year of painfullness with everyone in school not teacher call me that nickname they sure not punch me in the face or something like that but they punch me with their bad mouthing like u already act like girl why you make it worse with ur stupidity the other example everyone didnt believe what i said or what i hear they think im so stupid even if i do something smart or maybe the man stuff its impossible because its unmatched with my image and sometimes all of this is still haunting me like today my parents are no helping even my siblings my dad and brother its really boomer and really homopobhic sometimes if i act like girl too much they will offend me with act like queer on tv with intentions it looks like me and please stop act like girl i just can cry because i have no strength even tho i was have courage to fight my pride i always lose to my brother strengthness and end up scared to all boys so yeah even family i cant trust them too so after elementary school of hell i try to hide my feminism as much as i can but kinda fail sometimes but its not too feminime like myself in elementary so everyone dont bother to bully me anymore but i became lonely because im not really myself and i even forget how i was now im afraid to believe in people and have tho everyone is hate me and im not important in every event which makes me hate myself to look at mirror or took photo and video i try to avoid all of it as much as i can so i dont feel shitty and disgusted to myself anymore to make me happy if i have a little energy left sometimes every time im about to sleep i use my imagination if i have trusted two best friends and have big confident to be who i am and many imagination to make me look stronger sn yes i was crying typing this grinningfacewithsweat,1
my friend is being released from the psychiatric hospital tomorrow almost a month ago an old friend of mine went through a suicidal breakdown and he called me out of the blue for help after two years of no contact his family is hmong and they have very traditional gender roles he didnt know who else to talk to so he just called me he used to be my best friend in junior college and when he told me everything that was going on i drove four hours from where i was in the middle of the night to come get him and take him to the er and his family this happened the day before my partner and i broke up and she was in a psychiatric hospital herself my dad was also having some issues with his heart and i had been dealing with my own issues it was an absurdly tough period the last time i had seen him in person something very similar to this had happened and he hadnt spoke to me once since then until this particular night except to ask for a job reference the last time hed been on the edge i had told him he could always ask me for help and id always be there for him in the moment of as he explained what was going on it was all i could think about and i decided i was going to do my best to honor that commitment he ended up being admitted to a local hospital and ive stayed in contact with him since weve caught up on a lot and he explained why he cut contact the way he did the reasons are understandable and things got pretty emotional when he apologized thing is this was my dude when we were in school and no matter how much our friendship ending hurt when it did being human is an imperfect experience we fuck up we make mistakes ive made so many in my life more than i can count ive come to believe its not making mistakes that matters its how you respond and react to them resentment and hate are also such chaining and corrupting emotions theres so much freedom in forgiveness and i know all too well what its like to feel alone finally he is being released tomorrow i am so freaking excited for him i am so glad he is still here on this spinning rock i am so happy he is going to be okay im flying down from washington later today to spend some time with him ive been living through the most insane periods of my life and this one of the silver linings of it all more than anything im just glad that when he called as piss poor as the timing was that i was able to just help and that i have my friend back again so often im on the road for work and i wouldve been too far away to really be of any assistance i dont know how i wouldve responded had something else had happened ive seen too many people in my life for young in the past few years,0

the worst thing isnt being alone its being surrounded by people and them making you feel alone my roommates having his girl over for a romantic saturday and i told him i could find someone to hang out with to give them some space two days ago i texted cousins friends and co workers and everyone said they were busy or just plain didnt reply i shouldnt take this personally they are probably busy with stuff but ever since i graduated its like ive done nothing with my life and feel like im not interesting enough to hang out with i use to have a someone once who i did could always count on and hang out with but they cut me out of their life completely and i just feel like like such a loser,1
recently told i may have mild depressionfeeling kind of horrible about it ive been seeing a therapist for anxiety and she recently told me that i may also have mild depression i told her basically that various aspects of my life sometime seem too hard for me to do and i just think about how it would be easier if i wasnt here but that i would never act on these thoughts because that would be horrible for my family thats when she told me i may have mild depression which really shocked and saddened me because i had never thought i had depression i had the wrong impression that depression across the board meant it was hard for you to get daily tasks done which hasnt been true for me in terms of school i had completed everything on time received high marks and worked extremely hard on my projects same goes with my internship but now school and my internship are over and i feel lost hopeless and like time is running out for me to do something successful with my life every job app i read seems daunting exhausting and soulsucking i tell myself i just cant do it and i feel so horrible about it i have recently graduated and should feel proud and accomplished and while i know that i did well i dont see anything impressive about it i just feel like a failure kind of because the next steps are hard to initiate im pretty sure i have dysthymia and may talk more about this with my therapist ive definitely had these hopeless feelings for more than 2 years im afraid to tell my mom about this because i dont want her to be concerned but my therapist thinks putting me on an antidepressantanxiety meds will help me push through some things and i need to tell my mom this in order to get help as im still on her insurance telling her would probably explain myself to her better i just feel kind of lost and never thought this would happen to me edit im also hesitant to tell my mom about this because shes going thru something pretty stressful that concerns my sister rn and my mom had a panic attack about it last night i feel so stuck and will not be able to see my therapist for another 3 weeks,1
i left a military group and felt like an outcast so i just left a military group i shall explain stuff first my country has a post school activity which is basically a military activity but its milder adjusted and suitable for 1316 year olds there are 2 branches of the activity such as a freestyle group with foot drills and a activity where its like the first branch but with guns so i joined the gun group and the exercises and drills were easy to learn but hard to do i messaged my ic and he said i could leave and he doesnt blame us because of the injuries he had also faced i then left and felt like an outcast even tho my fellow members said its ok so what i am asking is that if any of you guys can help me cope with my stress,1
does it ever end im depressed all the time but these past 4 days have been so fucking unbearable i cant stop thinking about how much i hate my life i thought that it would be more manageable soon like oh i feel extremely bad now but very soon itll be less worse but no i still have no interest in anything and the one person i actually want to see i rarely now get to see,1
comfort in depression tell me if you guys also get this but i feel like ive become so good at faking like im okay and have my life together but like water filling a cup i feel myself reach a limit and i start to fight my depression but in a wayi miss it because theirs an odd feeling of comfort i find in it i know its bad suicide thoughts and negativity but it feels like the realest feeling than being happy but its dangerous territory i know butidk if i make sense when im happy i can feel a mini me trapped deep inside a cage wrapped in chains crying but i ignore it it feels like a second personidk lol,1
anyone else feel like depression has made you dumb i feel like i dont think as much anymore like depression killed all my brain cells im just numb and floating and not interested in anything i cant remember words very well sometimes it literally feels like my head is full of air edit wow i didnt think this would get so much response i made this post while i was in the middle of a brain fog at work instead of actually doing something important now i feel like it had a purpose to help you guys feel less alone im sorry youre all feeling the same way i know how hard it is thank you all for taking the time to share your experiences it really made me feel less alone i truly dont think any of us are dumb or stupid or whatever you want to call it we just have to recognise that its this horrible disease doing it to us i wish i could hug each one of you individually 3,1
i feel guilty about being depressed theres literally no reason for me to be depressed i have a good home ive never been abused i get good grades in school im not super popular or anything but i still have friends i have hobbies im good at everything im literally 17 years old this is supposed to be the happiest time of my life im supposed to look back on high school with nostalgia yet im still unhappy every day feels the same and i feel like no one truly cares about me ive never been in a relationship a real one at least which makes me feel like ill never fall in love im even lucky enough to go to therapy and be on medication people within a 5 mile radius of me have it so much worse so much worse i dont understand why i just cant be content with my life i dont understand why i feel like no one cares about me,1
depression losing intelligence the worst part about depression for me even worse than suicidal thoughts or constant pain is the huge toll it has on my mental faculties i think slower i need longer for decision making and understanding pretty basic things in conversations i cant plan anything because it is too much mental effort i read a sentence in a book and dont register the information its supposed to convey i cant think as deeply as a teenager i was able to hold my train of thought and look at a problem for a long time and find an intricate solution thats gone my ability to think any deeper than surface level is lost im not improving my programming skills even though i do it professionally on a daily basis i just dont seem to have the mental capacity for improvement it has been like that for years even worsening im worried that ill just stay depression stupid forever its also completely ruining my future because i cant make any sound decisions edit this blew up over night im thankful for the lively discussion in the comments thanks for the awards may you all find a way to get rid of this lots of love,1

school stress hello everyone im currently in my last year of high school and im having a hard time dealing with it i live in eastern europe and in my country we have those big exams at the end of high school that are supposed to evaluate all the knowledge youve gained since grade 1 two exams are mandatory one in literature and the other one you can choose the subject yourself for my second one i chose physics and im pretty confident with that however literature has always been a huge burden on mine and i find it extremely difficult to prepare for that exam i am beyond angered constantly that i have to deal with that subject i do understand that literature increases your knowledge about the world and teaches you how to support your arguments but the emphasis that is given on that exam by my teacher and parents is too big and i cant do anything but hate the guts out of it now me being the perfect student raised by perfectionist parents i cant even think about having low grades on that exam i study in a highly respected school where teachers can be pure evil to you i also have to prepare for my university entrance exams and work on a project of mine which stress me out even more at the end of the day i feel so drained out and like ive achieved nothing even though i have spent the whole day in school and preparing for exams ive started feeling physically unwell i used to work out a lot but now i dont have the energy to go out of my bed my blood pressure is very low and ive gained weight ive given up to emotional eating one too many times i wanna shine for prom i want to look my best at the end of the school year and feel my best when real life hits me but im scared that school will drain me out too much this is more of a rant post because i know the only way to fix the situation is by resting more i just cant let myself rest my mind is constantly busy with my work anyways any help or advice or simple encouragement would be appreciated if you made it that far thank you for taking the time to read about my problems,1
knowing that suicide is always an option gives me a lot of comfort am i weird how far down that depression rabbit hole am i i dont have a lot to add im depressed i guess this has been going on for decades i dont know anymore am i really depressed anymore or has it turned into something else i hate being awake i wake up every day in a state of shock overcome with dread i sleep as much as possible but i have always had insomnia so i only get a good nights sleep every 23 weeks i snap awake as soon as i start falling asleep ive tried medication therapy and jesus but nothing has helped i recently realized that living with my father is a huge source of stress and anxiety for me hes emotionally and mentally abusive to me every day i am moving out soon which is great i hope but i am not expecting all my problems to magically disappear despite it all i am working hard to get a good education and build a better life for myself why i honestly dont know because its expected of me i guess what do i want out of life to be happy of course but we all know that happy isnt realistically achievable life is never perfect so i guess i am aiming for something more modest like contentment to me contentment would be a quiet simple life with very little stress not a lazy life per se but one where there is little or no pressure on me to do things i simply dont want and dont need to do at this point of my life i have spent so much time in my head that i feel ive become unrelatable to regular folks,1

no matter what i do itll never be enough for me no matter how much time i spend with the family i have left im still depressed no matter how many friends ill make ill still be depressed even a loving relationship still doesnt distract me from the pain and i thought that was working but all i felt was nothing in the end i still cry every goddamn day at this time alone with my thoughts and insecurities i hate this life i hate how i was born in such a horrible position you know life would actually be a lot easier if my abusers werent fucking immediate family members but whats the point of pitying myself and whats the point of being hard on myself either i worked so hard only for a memory to kill the reality i had built for myself ive dated so many people and for what to be sexually abused just like my mother did to me just like my brother did to me it doesnt matter if he remember or thought its wrong at the time hell be dead like her ill still resent him like i still do with her i always wonder what life is like in other parts of the world what life being in a cabin is like isolated from the world or being in arranged marriage different cultures and rituals the primitive life those kinds of lives arent simple but nothing actually is its just different ways of surviving different ways of thinking but the complexity of it all is still the same and this life isnt any different where i have expectations to keep up with the suburban life have children get married and get a good job so i can keep the house and it sounds so easy but its the hardest challenges i dont have a job i dont even know how to ride a bike let alone a car i dont normally admit this but i feel like amberlynn reid i live pretty much like her and im so ashamed of it i eat food do nothing but listen to music and maybe just maybe play video games and it sucks that im so pretty but i have such poor health i have hit rock bottom in life but i guess starting now while im still alive i wont live like this whats the point of living in a life i never dreamed of being in i never wanted the american dream life did i in the end its an american nightmare for me never live like this never again even though my life was so luxurious and even though im both mentally and physically weak and ill be uncomfortable for a lot of it i wont let me kill myself,1
i found a unsent letter from my mom to my grandma and now im heartbroken my mom is away on vacation and i know she has some edibles hidden in her drawer so i thought itd be a good idea to steal a couple while she was gone i know i shouldnt have been doing that but thats honestly not important to me right now sorry while grabbing the jar of gummies i found a note right next to it the note reads as a letter that my mom wrote to her mom who passed away about 15 years ago the tldr of the letter is that my mom wished she knew the things she knows now as a parent when she was younger because she never appreciated how hard her mom worked for her she went into how she thinks she failed me because of my depression im open with my depression to my mom and she is supportive and that being a parent is hard but shes trying her best but her best isnt enough my mom has never spoken to me about her depression although she has mentioned it very briefly but reading that letter broke me harder than anything i can remember i just started bawling still am while writing this my mom is the most important thing to me in the world and learning that she thinks she is a failure makes me have suicidal thoughts because of how broken i feel about this but now i feel the pressure of making my mom proud and making sure she feels like she isnt a failure so obviously suicide is off the table at least until after she passes i just dont know if i have it in me to turn things around my depression has been the same ever since i was diagnosed with it in hs im 26 now im going to try to go out of my way and hug her more and tell her i love her and how much i appreciate her but i dont think ill ever get over knowing how she really feels about herself thanks for reading i needed to vent,1

trying to relax is stressing me out tldr at bottom so i know this isnt nearly as serious as some people on this sub reddit and i dont want to detract from those that really need help but im wondering if anyone else experiences this im on vacation first time in about a year that i have had several days designated to relax but i feel like i have so much on my plate that i cant relax work has been extremely stressful and i have been going the extra mile to make sure that things get done correctly there i feel like im sorry far behind at work that i might pass myself trying to catch up my wife an i have also trying to get the house ready for the largest family gathering we have ever had at our house finishing up a complete remodel and there are a bunch of little things that need to be done so that i feel people arent judging me with all that being said now that im here it feels more stressful to try to force myself to relax than it would be to just keep working and try to get caught up if i had the option of an invisibility cloak i would take off of work then go in so i can get caught up without anyone bothering me and pulling me away from the task at hand i dont know if these feelings are genetic or learned but i have heard my dad say essentially the same thing in past i am on meds for anxiety has anyone else ever experienced this tldr i feel stressed that im on vacation and not working maybe even a touch guilty,1

my life is a mess and i dont think itd be worth the time to clean it up im new to this subreddit and thought that this would be a good place get a couple of things off of my shoulders and just share my story so far i apologize for the lengthy post my depression started late in my sixth grade year it began with subtle thoughts of self harm and lengthy sessions of negative thinking by the end of the school year my family moved to the out skirts of a small town bordering the state of washington once we settled in my mother forced me to ride out the last few weeks of school my first day at the new school felt unwelcoming most people generally ignored me and the few that didnt were very manipulative using the fact that i was new to bolster their reputation by the time that summer vacation rolled around my only friend invited me to stay at his house for the majority of the break most of the things that plagued my mind faded into obscurity only coming back during long nights nearing the end of my stay my friend decided to show me his grandfathers stash of firearms with the supervision of his grandfather later that night i had developed a plan to use one of the guns to end it all but never came to fruition due to leaving the next day the rest of the summer flew by leading into the next school year i was still relatively new to the school so i was still in the same circumstances i was last year a new element that was introduced was a lack of interest and work ethic which lead to my grades plummeting late november i was met with extreme fatigue that would last throughout the day resulting in me sleeping through the majority of my classes this would continue to the next school year i still hadnt made any friends only interacting with others when i had to during lunch breaks i usually sat alone sometimes being bothered by groups of the popular kids to get me to say something to satisfy their curiosity and boredom or a concerned teacher or staff member the end of the year my grades hung around failing and barely passing resulting in me going to summer school this summer was uneventful besides summer school my friend didnt make any attempts to reach out to talk to me so i just laid around stewing in my thoughts in the isolation of my room 8th grade was like 7th grade only differing slightly my period of isolation during the summer had left stricken with disturbing thoughts paranoia and anxiety during group activities i struggled with speaking to others finding myself stammering when trying to speak at a normal rate and spoke quietly i became embarrassed and would intentionally push myself away from projects later in the year one of the annoying kids became excessively irritating and decided to wake me as i slept during science class i broke my silence and started to berate him this left a lasting impression with some of my classmates after that day i started to focus on my anger as time went on our fights became long winded and increasingly aggressive not long after i got physical with him after he had confronted me outside of class he said something that i took offense to so i grabbed him by the shoulders and slammed him against the lockers after that event he gradually stopped speaking around me and skipped the last day once he had heard that i was going to fight him the summer was the same as last year summer school was as helpful as ever and my only friend not making any attempts to speak with me i again left to my thoughts of constant anger and depression my freshman year began slightly different i had developed a friendship with a girl that rode the bus with me she was also dealing with depression due to her abusive and controlling mother my depression dramatically increased in late november when i developed a crush on a girl from my neighborhood i became self destructive insulting my appearance and intelligence i came home in a bad mood all the time either in a blinding rage or in tears i convinced myself that i wasnt good enough for her and that nobody cared about me that i was worthless a week before christmas break i had come up with a new plan to kill myself the last week before christmas break was unbearable the thought of suicide weighed heavily on my mind thoughts constantly screaming at me throughout the day the last day before break during first period i broke down in tears i went to my councilor and confessed that i was going to kill myself after christmas day i was then taken to the hospital and was diagnosed with depression i the spent about a week and a half in the hospital and was released early due to good behavior some acting good attendance to activities and the fact that christmas was coming i left being prescribed zoloft and felt relatively normal for once in a long while christmas break came to an end not long after and school felt very much different in mid to late january i began getting migraines from taking zoloft and was shortly changed to fluoxetine not long after i then started to prepare for valentines day a couple of days before valentines day my friend and i went to get some flowers for my crush i had made plans with my crush to meet up but she missed it and rearranged for the 17th we met up that night and i confessed my feelings to her to the best of my ability she told me that she didnt feel the same way and friend zoned me we havent spoken since i broke down in tears later that night spiraling back down into my depression i would find out sometime later that she never had any feelings for me and was already in a relationship before my confession covid would soon come around to cut the school year short and brought a new wave of anxiety and fear on top of my failed attempt at a relationship around mid may i stopped taking my medication thinking that i didnt need it any longer june through august made a great amount of progress on myself i began the next school year happier than the last and put effort into my work this would last until november i quickly fell back into my old habits constantly degrading myself in late november i found out how my sisters truly felt about me they felt nothing but hate for me doing nothing but insult my appearance and intelligence and the fact that had no friends to their knowledge in december my fights with my sister got worse and now my mother started to side with my sisters and said that ive changed for the worst that i wasnt her son wishing for the old me to come back she than grounded me and took all of my possessions she would threaten me with the hospital and would threaten to call the cops if i didnt comply this would continue throughout january and end in early february after that happened i began looking for friends so i had someone to relate to by march i had found a couple of people that gave me purpose to live again they helped me find a job and gave me someone to talk to when a felt like nothing in april i started working and hanging out with my friends more often by may it all fell apart i had gotten angry at work from being overwhelmed and two of my friends were working with me that day they thought that i was satan himself and started to spread rumors about me as a result i lost all of my friends and almost lost my job since then ive kept my job but have started to inflict pain upon myself from cuts to burns ive apologized to everyone since but i still hate myself for everything ive felt worse ever since then and have been struggling with my battle against depression once again i hope that i can get some advice or at least get some comfort so i can try to get back on track,1
right now killing myself sounds like an ideal idea my life is stuck ive been unemployed since april im 25 since the outbreak my family with whom i still live mainly my father is putting so much emotional stress on me yet without that stress i dont think i wouldve gotten to where i am now you can say the pain has pushed me to do stuff i started working on myself meditating reading more trying to excercize damn ive started painting watercolor i dont how we do it but we always find away to misinterpret one another in my family assuming the worst in the other we lack communication but isnt that something to blame on the parent for not initating it in childhood i dont know where i am right now but the idea of not existing anymore is tempting me so bad im tired of thinking i know i wont do it but man these thoughts they stick around once they hold onto you dont they its different when you want to end your life because your life sucks and when you want to end it because there are things you dont want to deal with anymore i dont know it lacks the selfpity feels almost like an act of selflove edit this is unbelievable thank you everyone for your incredible support i hope everyone struggling finds hope like i have found in your comments i think hypersensitivity is really a doubleedged sword i cant take negativity so well but i aslo have the greatest ability to absorp hope and support if i find them and i have thanks to you guys i feel surrounded by friends it was a good idea to post this i hope everyone takes the suicidal ideation discussed above with a grain of salt i was really verging on madness who knows what i would have done if i didnt write this after reading some comments im reminded again that depression lies thank you again ill try to be kinder to myself,1
i dont feel alive just passing the time i am 28 years old man having a 22 years old sister and parents in the family it is going to be the quite long post but i think its important to mention everything my parents had an arrange marriage 30 years ago my father comes from a full fledged patriarchal mindset family when my mother delivered me via c section delivery my father kicked her in the abdomen because she wants to watch tv and my father wanted to sleep she had bleeding due to broken stitches but he manipulated my mother and my mother said to doctor that she fell down from stairs there is no evidence or proof of that incident but it happened everyone knows about this in my family but no one talks about it throughout their 30 years of marriage my mother has gone through a lot of mental trauma and abuse right now she is 52 years old and is suffering from high blood pressure anxiety hypertension and depression my father is still the same person and regularly tortures my mother last week he shouted at her she got so scared that her blood pressure shot up to 215120 she said she felt like that she would die that day it shattered my heart into pieces i want to help my mother but my mother still dont want to be vocal about the trauma she is going through and she had gone through she says that he is after all her husband and still thinks a lot about society and stigma i highly doubt if i seek any legal help she would change her statement which will obviously questions her testimony my father also knows how to take advantage of it and manipulates her for his own purposes she does everything unwillingly because she thinks thats she is supposed to do and other options are out of her way i have lost all the respect for my father and chances are i might hit him physically or punch him in the jaw if hed shout at my mother again right now i am staying in a hotel and couldnt sleep for 4 days my mother will die breaks my heart if this keeps going on my father has no shame or realisation of anything my sister lives in hostel and havent come to home since an year because she is also going through depression and anxiety i am also going through same issue and taking counselling i have started meditation also to keep my mind calm but one such incident triggers everything and it pushes my will to live life backward what should i do people say that my mother is also indirectly responsible for everything and if she doesnt want to leave him i shouldnt worry myself and move on with my life but i cant see her suffering i know she probably may not know what she is doing but all i know that she is going through something which she never deserves pls suggest,1
managing stress at work stress makes me ill they do not pay me enough to make me ill over the years i have stuck to some basic rules they may already be on rstress anyway it is good to share negative stress is a term i heard used for things that you have no way of controllingfixingmoving forward this type of stress is a killer if you find yourself dealing with negative stress tell your boss you dont work for your boss your boss works for you it is their job to make sure you can do yours the higher up in a company someone works the more people they work for delegate your problems upwards if you can see a way to destress your boss do it a stressed boss is hard to delegate to positive stress is facing the challenge of doing things that you might be able to achieve at least it is in my vocabulary positive stress is still stress although some people get such a kick from it they actually create stressful situations avoid these people i do my best to see problems as challenges when you have things to do and you find the sheer volume or complexity daunting break the job down i am talking ticking things off lists for quantity tick off every time you have dealt with x amount of doodahs for complexity break the job into smaller tasks and tick them off as you go starting can be the hardest thing so get ticking as soon as you can remember you can only eat an elephant one bite at a time edit and never break down your day into hours to tick off tick off jobsqty not time,1

everything is difficult and im losing it this isnt even just a stress thing like everything i do is physically difficult other people in my class handed in their work mine got turned back twice then i had no paper my mum said shed get paper didnt get it she forgot over and over again and i didnt get the bloody paper till weeks later then i messed up my work a bunch of times then finally handed it in i specifically remember handing it in my teacher says he cant find it now i have no drafts nothing i decided to leave class to go home and quickly do it itll be easy i thought all my notes are on my computer its just a case of drawing circles and numbering them its a design i got home and my computer is not working i need the computer to complete this i could have asked my teacher for his copy of the notes but he is in a meeting why is everything in my life like this i could be asked to take the dog for a walk and somehow my life will find ridiculous things to throw at me one dog will hurt their paw another will run off the leads will snap somehow theres no where selling anything that could be used as a lead the park will be shut at the exact time i was supposed to go you get the idea seriously what the fuck this is like a sketch on a tv show or something its absolutely ridiculous this always happens and im so done does anyone else have this as i said its not just stress its just something that always happens and it makes me stressed i dont know what to do there is no way i can fix the computer,1
just totally apathetic at this stage not sad or angry any more simply dont feel anything but numbness for a long time nearly my entire life i felt a lot of anger and sadness over my situation i hated my self and everyone else i never had many friends and because i was a social outcast in my youth i am now at the age of 21 with fuck all friends those of which im friendly with all have lives of their own and multiple friend groups to juggle so i see them only every few months while i dont meet anyone in the mean time and go about my day not talking to anyone i started taking meds and i didnt notice much difference so i stopped and made a conscious effort to try to better myself i started dressing well started having a hair and skincare routine and exercising and eating right ive put on a decent amount of muscle and i look the best i have ever for the first time in my life ive noticed women looking at me and smiling as i make eye contact with them and smile back im not a bad looking person even though for years i very much felt i was and neglected to care for myself as a result despite the validation of seeing these good looking women notice me for the first time ever it is all in vain all of my efforts are futile as we walk by each other never to see each other again im not even afraid to talk to women like i used to be as i have a lot more confidence these days i feel as though my sudden confidence around women is tied to the fact that im just numb and so over it all all of the effort i put into myself is in vain because nothing ever happens it was easier when i didnt take care of myself didnt shower eat or sleep i put in all of this effort to genuinely look pretty good and yet its all worthless because no one stops to speak to me they look at me smile and keep walking and so do i,1
i just want to have a friend thats all ive ever wanted i dont know why i push everything away,1
what should i do about chronic stress hi im 20 years old and kind of accepting that ive got chronic stress issues im not sure how to deal with it exactly and its been 3 months i remember seeing a doctor a while ago and talked about what caused my stressbreakdown last semester and he said it was acute stress i didnt really know what that meant at the time but overall i felt like it was an unhelpful experience because all of his advice exercise things like that and wisdom didnt really help me or i knew would not work because i had already tried i even tried antidepressants because i thought it could have been something i needed but that did not help id say for the past 2 years of my life ive done a great job at handling acute stress that was the only type of stress i knew chronic stress however is something that i dont understand its new to me and requires a greater amount of life changes and mental perspective it feels inhuman almost to have chronic stress it is admittedly frustrating because i feel too young for it im at an age where i should continue to develop myself with my hobbies and stuff but instead every day is typically a rollercoaster my ability to concentratefocus has been incredibly diminished and i find the idea of getting back in to school stressful i am an engineering major but if math stresses me out im just not sure if i can keep it in my life on the flip side i want to be doing those things because i liked the challenge the stress is like a token that just keeps flipping and makes things confusing i doubly worry because i start to think i have mental health issues and the fact is that stress can open up mental health issues i find that when the stress gets to a breaking point which has only happened once in my life i shut down and withdraw and make what changes feel necessary instead of opening up in to some sort of mania or whatever but fuck man how am i supposed to know what to expect if it keeps going there are things which cause me stress that i dont think are supposed to cause me that much stress but they simply do because its chronic i guess i dont know if im supposed to push on and work on my problems in the storm or withdraw and bide my time i also seem to suffer from anhedonia an inability to feel pleasure if i isolate myself from anything stressful school work etc it is possible to feel some pleasure albeit a small amount ive been trying to tackle the problem by getting back in to the things that used to give me pleasure weightlifting was a big one and then taking on the more stressful things school and work but the stressful things seem to outdo any pleasure effects what really kills me is that my sleep suffers if i could get 8 hours a night i would be able to push through without worrying but for the past 3 nights ive gotten probably 56 hours of sleep i havent even started school yet and i dont really work that much so now im sitting here typing this post and worrying about stress again i truthfully dont know what to do or what in particular causes my chronic stress i want to live life like normally so i can combat depression and things like that but then the stress keeps me up i am seeing a counselor and hopefully a therapist soon but i am in the early stages of that is this something that can be medicated can you medicate stress away or does it boil down to lifestyle changes ive done a pretty damn good job of having a healthy lifestyle for the past couple years which is another frustrating thing i dont drink smoke but admittedly i think about sex too much and id say that is my vice at the moment it was also a source of stress for me that contributed to this chronic stress in some way that said i dont pursue sex in an unhealthy way but i might be a little more flirty or resort to jackin it to try and fill some sort of void that im missing i eat pretty healthily not a fan of soda or junk food i see food more as calories and less for pleasure other than that i loved weightlifting and for a good while was able to do both cardio and heavy lifting now however i feel like that contributes to my stress a little bit because i know i dont sleep enough to be able to lift weights and recover without it causing too much stress i want to bulk up a bit and get back to more intenseheavier lifting but im not sure if thats even healthy for me in my given state at the same time i get stressed out after a week or two if im not doing that lol again with the flipping a token thing i dont really like being around my friends or people as much when im like this not because i am in a bad mood but because i know i cant simply vibe with them ill be too worried about feeling stressed out to actually enjoy it this is why i think i really like counseling because its just a place for you to go to talk about your problems with someone my only solace has been learning how to play my guitar but thats not what i intend to do with the rest of my life and it doesnt always take the stress away sometimes i just get tired of playing it what are my options im 20 years old live at home with my dad so i dont have much responsibility thankfully ive done quite a bit with my life that im happy about so i feel like i was doing what i wanted so its tough thinking about how to change all the things ive been doing have helped me grow as a person and alleviate that sort of depression you get when youre just not doing anything with yourself but again now when i start doing those things i experience a lot of stress and have to come to a stop thus depression can come back i kind of yearn for when things didnt feel this stressful the first two years of college feel like they could have been ages ago and man i thought that was a challenge because during that time i was just finding myself looking back on it though it was just easy to live in the present and deal with stress as it came not battling it every waking hour i understand things about mindfulness meditation making the right choices etc but man that doesnt explain why i cant get enough sleep,1
i wish it just ended hi guys i am depressed 28 year old today is a saturday after a long week at work and everything i ddi was crying and then just smoked a joint and took a lorazepam to put me to sleep now its dark already i have a very locely boyfriend and friends but i am escaping all social situations and literally told my boyfriend to let go and forget about me i feel such a piece of trash guys i am only in peace inagining a dead me and all these horrible feelings will be gone i just wanted to get this out take care of all your friends and family and enjoy life as much ss you can redheart,1
i cant its really hard for me to fight this depression alone i have no one close to me ive never had i still cant accept the fact that no one cares about my mental health i know i cant depend on someone its really hard but im the only person i have and i cant help myself i dont wanna fight anymore,1
dad wants me to stop taking antidepressants im going through withdrawal and i cant get in to see my doctor for a prescription refill for another two weeks its really bad im crying a lot im on the verge of selfharm relapsing after being 2 clean without struggle and i just feel lonely shitty and without purpose my mom wants me to get my meds soon but my dad keeps insisting that i just continue going coldturkey hes a tough guy hes obsessed with war vets and military discipline and he thinks that my meds will make me fucked up and worse in the long run he just tells me to be stronger and stop being so weakminded he wont shut up about it and i just dont know how to convince him that i literally am suicidal without meds,1
my collection of grief i have never posted here guess you could say im a lurker like many others i never thought i deserved to take away from their spotlight i guess like it was selfish for me to think i had it bad when i know others have it worse it seems like a lot of people go from sorrow to emptiness i kinda did the opposite and i am sure this is more natural than i think but now its like i dont know how to handle it same old shit fucked up childhood fucked family shitty ex girlfriend who said i abused her 8 months after leaving me for a coworker of mine lost family and friends alike even had to see a detective about it no physical abuse but lots and lots of mental stuff from both my mother and that girlfriend dont talk to a big portion of my family now only just recently started seeing my dad again not because he did anything wrong really but i closed everything off and everyone i had to move out i had no money so i ended up having to max out my credit card just to survive car broke down shortly after now i needed a car more debt i became reckless i used to be great at saving money but when your money just goes to making someone else rich while you struggle to pay for food i want something for myself sometimes damnit that was 7 years ago now i still have the debt of a broken man physically in a better place and realistically mentally too but not by much i dont get into a car or walk into a building and imagine all the different ways i could kill myself in there at least not as much my emptiness has overflowed into a cataclysm of dread and sorrow i went to therapy finally quite recently people say money cant buy happiness but after 8 appointments i got a bill for over 600 dollars whoever says that is either a fool or an asshole after seeing the bill i canceled all further appointments and havent gon back since hadnt gone long enough to make any real progress towards anything i did however find out that i have a severe form of dysthymia which is basically just persistent depressive and also general anxiety im sure this isnt an unheard of thing but i am basically never not in a state of depression its almost like being bipolar but with a smaller mood range i am either terribly sad depressed or helplessly hopelessly exhaustively woven into despair that i crawl into bed after work and cry for hours and everytime i think its over and try to get out of bed i take a couple steps and realize that i am not done and have to go back to it apparently it happens at some point in a lot of people lives but i have never not felt this way for as long as i can remember i cant find true joy in anything my life consists of finding things that might make me happy and working towards obtaining them only to get them and have them become just another thing i think that is how my collection started i collect comic books and figurines books i think my collection is the only thing i can consider myself proud of though its like i cant grow myself so i instead watch it grow each new thing a small victory proof that im alive and building something like some sort of faux legacy to pass on i am meaningless to this world but maybe i will live on in my stuff heirlooms to pass down or something even when i was empty i believed that i just had to push that i could make my life something prove to people who wronged me that i was worth more they would live in the shadow of my success and finally feel the worthlessness i have felt now though i am not empty i am losing hope everyday is this it the meaning of life not surviving not prevailing just existing existing until its not time to exist anymore every day you give up just a little bit more a personal race to break your last record of perseverance to see how long you can make it how long it takes for you to give up truth is we all would have given up by now i am not sure if the reason is the same for everyone my reason for still being here is because im worried the afterlife might be boring interesting right this may be our only time and even if it is terrible and nothing good ever happens at least im not bored i could be reincarnated as an anime protagonist in a world where my life could mean something not without turmoil but with wonder and awe and maybe a harem i dont know dont judge me it seemed like a goofy joke at first reincarnated into a magical world where the problems were different but i could mean something to someone or something surrounded by friends who are cool but also kind throw in some overpowered bullshit powers and i am good to go it started as a joke but i want that i want to be somewhere else i want to be someone else a different world i different plane of existence where i could start over without the problems of before somewhere where it would be possible to truly find peace i want that i dont want to die never knowing what happiness felt like only to live an eternity of regret and emptiness hardships are eternal wherever you go but please let me be able to find joy in things a quote i always like was you can either live a life of meaning or you can live a life of happiness you cannot have both i already cant be happy a life of meaning makes the most sense now i fear i will not have either,1
im 14 and i havent done any school work for 7 weeks i feel so fucking useless and i just want it to end we went into another covid lockdown 10 weeks ago and when school started again online i did barely any work and now ive just been sitting at my desk feeling empty i really want to do my work but i just cant there are 3 more weeks left of the term and all ive been doing is aimlessly surfing the web i wish i didnt let my teachers and everyone around me down the other night my dad was talking to me about how bad i was doing at school and that everyone else is better than me he said that i wont be able to get a job or afford a house i dont have the best relationship with my dad but after hearing that i just wanted to die my mum on the other hand is very kind and i talked to her for an hour about how i was feeling but it sort of hurt when she said i wasnt worthless i think ive been depressed since last year at least and towards the end things were getting better for me but after the christmas holidays one of my closest friends died and everything just seemed to fall apart this lockdown seems like its been my breaking point i feel completely dead inside i got diagnosed a few weeks ago and i thought that if people knew parents and 2 friends it might get a bit better but now i feel more alone than ever i think i should tell my school but i was depressed sounds like a shitty excuse for not working i want people to know how im feeling but i dont want their pity sorry i just needed to rant,1

urgent 247 head pressure and awful brain fog symptoms 247 head pressure in the top back of my head and over my ears to the back awful brain fog where i can barely drive or go in stores or do much of anything i feel like im in a dream like state to an extent where everything is in a fog and its like im not really present i believe this is called dissociation i also have blurry vision and just overall feel very off i cant remember the last time i felt truly energized and overall just well this is going to be a long post but i greatly appreciate whoever contributes in october of last year i got extremely stressed i moved to california and got an apartment 2 weeks before covid hit in march and immediately everything was shut down buildings were boarded up i was okay most of the year until i lost my job and started freaking out about how im going to pay rent etc also my wisdom teeth started causing problems and i needed to get them removed once i found out the price for this i didnt have insurance yet it caused severe stress it seemed like everything from lack of job lack of money lack of social life lack of interaction was just taking over with physical symptoms of stress and anxiety i have had nights where i wake up gasping for air as if im not breathing i have had many days where i cant even walk or do activity because i feel so faint i have spoke to 2 psychiatrists about this and explained how my symptoms have been 247 for now 7 months and they both said they havent heard of stress and anxiety being a constant for that long without a break i have tried lexapro for a month and a half at 10 mg which i know is a low dose and it had no effect i have went to every specialist from ent neurologist emergency room twice eye doctor neuro ophthalmologist allergist and gotten every scan imaginable from mri to mra to mrv to ct to angiogram and everything is always normal these symptoms have pretty much debilitated me from living my life in any way which has then let to depression from having no life its got to the point where just going to a new doctor appointment would make me feel extremely anxious and faint because i feel like its just an ongoing series where i go to the doctor and they dont help and i repeat for months everything is just centered around the stress and anxiety of what could be causing this and doctors having no idea every single day i search my symptoms and constantly am online looking into this its pretty much all i do whats throwing me off is the 2 psychiatrist saying these symptoms cant be constant because i have seen other posts online saying otherwise the last psychiatrist said i can try zoloft i would appreciate if anyone can comment having dealt with similar symptoms and letting me know if zoloft or any ssri helped i know getting off the computer and outside more can be very helpful thanks for any feedback,1

i often fantasize about something tragic happening to me so i have a reason to be depressed or dont have to participate in life for a little while just today on my way to work i found myself hoping somebody would lose control in the rain and cause an accident ive even imagined contracting covid19 so i can self quarantine and not have to deal with life for a couple weeks edit welp i got to work where weve been doing mandatory temperature checks for all employees and i have a mild fever so i got turned away now that something is actually happening ive become so anxious perseveringface,1
stress related to low self esteem and surprisingly powerful coping strategy hi all i generally suffer from low self esteem i have periods where i feel completely worthless its not helped by the fact that i have to write weekly status reports at work when writing a status report i have to make an account of the progress ive made during the week it takes roughly 15 to 20 minutes to write the report and theres not much to put on to the list or so i thought last week i decided that i wanted to spare myself from the stress from writing the report and just write down my progress as it was made the list of completed work tasks were three times as long as ususal turns out im quite forgetful this was a major self worth boost and it made today an all around great and satisfying day,1
anxiety or stress how can you tell if anxious or stressed my stomach makes noise often and cause flatulence and belching accompanied with acid reflux slow digestion and i think anxiety or stress is doing it,1
job making my depression worse hi everyone this is my first post so plz be gentle with me i have pretty bad anxiety and depression and i cant seem to keep a job for more than a couple of weeks because of it recently i started working again since the pandemic and it was going well at one job until i got a better offer somewhere else however now that job is giving me more anxiety and depression than i think its worth it is kind of my dream job until i finish college but its full time while im also in school full time as well and they dont have any parttime options for me ive only been there for about a week but every single shift i find myself completely dissociated and unable to focus on anything then when i get home it takes several hours to calm down and be able to do any of my school work let alone regular life things i feel shitty for wanting to quit but i dont really know what else to do any advice,1
can depression make you hate being around people i know im going to sound like a horrible person but lately whenever someone talks to me i find myself just wishing that they would stop and leave me alone i find every single person i interact with annoying in one way or another i dont know whats going on i never express my annoyance of course its not their fault,1
cant fall asleep before another 11 hour shift the title says it all my body is now always in alert mode even when i try to dial down it is the end of 3am and i have to be back there at 6am until either 5 or 6 pm in a humid laborious position where there is no sitting only go do this go cut this climb up these stairs 4 dozen times to clean these pipes covid and its lack of employees in places caused this 8 hour job to be turned into a 12 hour rut for the existing staff and now i wonder why i am doing what im doing i needed money so that is my fault but although i am relatively athletic and my body is turning cut and defined i feel exhaustion and sadness about giving 12 hours of my day to this place but i try to remember how important my job is to the growth of society infrastructure manufacturing i dont have the determination to pretty up my resume but know to get any job that doesnt only take the salt of the earth types i must even coming home after these shifts to piss being on the floor because my 35 year old roomate doesnt give a shit is too much for me it has been which is one of many reasons why my girl and i are leaving but i need a good paying job to support us and be independent with her ah adult life,1
im so fucking done with this shit i feel like my family never takes me seriously my mother thinks im a hypochondriac and my brother is so damn ignorant towards mental illness whenever i tell my mother how im feeling or my health concerns it seems like she just disregards it like its a papercut my brother tells me advice things like life is painful everyone goes through that or cope with it god how fucking ignorant can one be you arent the one with depression you will never understand what it feels like you will never understand what its like to live with that your whole life depression is not just feeling sad you cannot just get over it goddamnit im tired of getting shitfaced and high because of how i feel instead of just doing it to have fun i just feel empty when im not drunk or high all i want is somebody who understands where im coming from as nobody i know really seems to or most likely doesnt even care i dont know anymore im rambling,1

stress due to online education my masters in psychology course began two months ago and its been completely online something im not used to ive always had school in person i have 9 assignments due before the 9th of january and i feel very overwhelmed im getting stressed and i feel like i want to cry all the time im really trying to take care of myself but its not happening and im either stressing or working on my assignments,1

denying depression have you every seen anyone with a really angry face saying im not angry my clinically depressed wife takes her meds every day but spends most nights of the week arguing with me over completely nothing i try to be caring and explain that its the depression making her feel that way ive even done cbt courses with her but everytime she argues about this mindless stuff she denies shes suffering from depression from the outside i can see its textbook depression i cant say a single sentence without her taking it as a personal attack on her she doesnt let me explain anything the next day when she calms down she apologizes and admits it was all depression but the amount of time we are losing arguing is causing huge problems in our lives is there anyway i can get her to admit when shes having a depressive episode so we can work on it,1
apparently depression is just attentionseeking stupidity to people when i get like this i tend to google what im thinking i googled one of the biggest things about myself why does making myself feel bad make me feel better super simple just a lack of better terms typical answers were things like you were abused as a kid and it became all you know nooe not it you need a therapist i dont want to pay someone just to tell me i have a problem i know i do self harm and suicide number typical i want to help by not helping so ill just leave the suicide hotline number instead then one of the answers is a long paragraph about how depression is just attention seeking you got everything your way when you cried as a kid so youre crying now in hopes that someone pities you theyd called it stupidity and realizing youre just a serial attention seeker will make that stupidity go away it felt like a dagger was plunged into my chest when i read that surely no one agrees with that nope one of the top answers fuck when i cried as a kid because i didnt get what i wanted i still didnt get what i wanted i got spanked and sent to my room i dont want people to give me nice words on the contrary id rather people be dicks to me selfloathing and such is a comfort feeling and i know that makes me selfish i harmed after that i dont cut myself or anything im too much of a stupid fucking pussy i asphyxiate myself typically with a chord this time it was a long piece of plastic packaging that i wrapped around my neck ive written about this here in the past ive only recently come to the realization that i use it as a physical and psychological way to make myself feel awful and cause harm rather than attempt to off myself i just dont know of this counts as anything more since it doesnt leave a scar its probably just some silly dumb thing and nobody takes it seriously because im just being a fucking baby yeah that well whatever here i am making a post because im a serial attention seeker that should just keep all of this inside so i dont spread my stupidity silly me,1
hurry sickness how have i not known about this term this type of sickness has plagued me for the past 3 years ive had increasing amounts of stress as expectations placed upon me life responsibilities work responsibilities have increased more and more hurry sickness google search it became impossible to relax id fill up all my empty time with things to do yet id complain that i was too stressed to do anything else its a disease its toxic and i didnt know i had this sickness until this week i am sharing this with you so that you might understand whats going on doing more and more and more and being able to multitask 15 things at once its not a trophy its a sign of a sickness its just a shame how oppressive society has become that its members are encouraged to take on loads of responsibilities to the point of chronic burnout and redline,1
nostalgia is not as pleasant when youre depressed for most people nostalgia is generally accepted as being a nice feeling a pleasant memory but for me it just reminds of a more innocent happier time when i was child i thought my future was good and all i cared about was playing with friends and climbing trees how things have changed edit i genuinely didnt expect so many kind comments even on a sub like this i feel better and i have you all to thank for that,1
is todays world too stressful its too stressful for some people and just fine for others i find it too stressful some days and other days i feel like im coping whether or not you feel stressed comes down to yourperspective if you think that somethings stressful guess what youre going to feel stressed why do we get stressed some people feel stressed because of timesometimes its hard to believe you can fit everything into one day you go to a job for 8 to 10 hours and then you come home and have to do chores and make dinner for you and maybe even an entire family after dinner you probably have more chores and a checklist of todos that have been eating away at your mind for weeks you go to bed and then wake up to do it all over again some people feel stressed because of their environmentshumans have built cities concrete concrete concrete busy busy busy we naturally feel more relaxed when we see green and natural landscapes but now theres people everywhere and not a flower in sight it seems like we never have a minute of calm anymore not to mention all the places you have to go in one day maybe work is a stressful place maybe your house is more chaotic than you want it to be even your commute to work can feel stressful sometimes some people feel stressed from meaninglessnessits hard to do the same thing over and over again and feel like you have no end goal you constantly have chores to do a job to perform and likely a family or people to take care of everyday but where the heck does it get you at the end of the day what are you working towards all of these points make the world sound like a pretty crappy place but lets think about the things wedonthave to stress about you probably dont have to worry about hunting for food finding shelter in winter or worry about a bear attacking you and your family its funny how society meets all of our needs yet we still find so many things to be stressed about how can we become unstressed unfortunately its hard to eliminate stress completely in one day werehabitual creatures you probably get stressed about similar things throughout the week you have developed stress habits over the course of your life in order to break these habits you have to performselfchecksand developselfawarenessso you can stop yourself before you go down a stress path you have to becomeconscious of you stressbefore you can stop it figure out whats making you stressed honestly a lot of people dont know what makes them stressed i have times in the day when i feel anxious but i have no idea why so i started writing things down when i got stressed i recorded how i felt what was happening in my environment and what time of day it was i also tried journaling a bit at night and performingselfchecksthroughout the busy day i learned that you have to start talking to yourself you have to ask yourselfhow youre doingfrom this experience i found patterns in my stress behaviour i usestress freeto keep track of my daily trends simply put only you cause your own stress no matter what you blame your stress on your environment your boss your spouse your kids at the end of the dayyour stress is your faultokay external factors like poverty or an unhealthy marriage obviously dont facilitate being stressed but it comes down to realizing that youre the problem until you stop blaming external factors for your stress you cant fix it for example if you blame your job for your stress your brain is convinced that the stress will only go away if the job goes away youre practicingselfhelplessness before you can make changes come to the realization that youre the one making yourself stressed i know its mean but thats life feel grateful for what you havesometimes i forget to be grateful for what i have my family is in good health i have a wonderful boyfriend and i have a secure job right out of university no matter how great of a situation were born into or weve made for ourselves we still find ways to be stressed we make things up in our head when i get that promotion ill be happy when i finally get married ill be happy you cant just keep looking into the future for your happinessyou have to practice happiness in the now try meditation and breathing exercisesokay youre probably rolling your eyes meditation and mindfulness seem to becoming buzz words now but in all honesty meditation is how i developed my selfawarness im constantly training myself to check in with my emotions and stop myself from going down my stress paths its hard to meditate at first its hard to sit in silence and ask yourself tough questions i mean when do we ever experience complete silence anymore were either on our phone listening to music watching netflix or keeping ourselves busy so practiceliterally doing nothing eat healthier get more sleep youve probably read a lot of blog articles about getting your beauty sleep or eating super foods i approach these rules in my own way i try to eat a bit of everything but

my world is so much fuller with people who love me than i couldve ever expected bonus pic of adorable dog included a few days ago in a moment of crisis i nearly made a permanent choice to a temporary situation its so strange to think about now i didnt even recognize who i was was at the time it was practically an out of body experience the one person who i had thought would always have my back if i ever found myself in this situation couldnt help me and wasnt able to for a few reasons anyhow for the last year or so ive largely viewed myself as being alone on this spinning rock of seven billion people and i sure as hell was convinced of it at the moment one call with someone i hadnt talked to in nearly half a year stopped me from committing the irreversible from that moment on and since then there has been someone there for me to support me first there was my younger sister who ive had a strained relationship the past few years she told me she loved me and has been talking messaging me since an aunt who i never in a million years wouldve expected to care came and got me her with two of her friends on vacation talked with me listened for hours to everything i had to say they fed me gave me clarity on a lot and supported me in ways i never wouldve expected from anyone the aunt gave me her number and told me to message her if i ever needed anything my dad has been calling me almost every day and he said hed be there in any way i needed him to my mom hugged me and we cried she too has been giving me a lot of advice and talking to me about a lot of things beyond them so many other people as well have reached out to me business associates old friends family distant and close and even acquaintances my email and phones have had so many notifications from all of them its blown my mind how many people care about my well being the past few years ive focused so much of my time and energy into building my profession and businesses traveling putting my love for what i do above everything else even my own well being and time spent with others it got to the point where everyone around me was just like a blimp in the past paced rhythm of my life i had met a girl and she was the only constant for most of the last nine months there are so many things i wouldve missed out on if it hadnt been for the support i received and its been weighing heavily on my mind i wouldnt have been able to pet my cat or take my dog on another walk my family wouldve been devastated i wouldve never able again to watch another sunset or feel the wind on my skin while driving with the windows down i wouldve never been able to get a second masters degree take another great picture im a pro photog travel any more or meet any more terrific people i wouldve never gotten to buy a house settle down meet and marry a wife one day or even have kids i am just so glad i am still here still alive rumi said the would is the place where the light enters and now i can see that so clearly i never knew or imagined i mattered so much to so many people i have so much relief that i am still here still alive you really never know who will actually be there to support you when push comes to shove even now i am just looking out the window as i write this looking at the ocean and the clouds and i am realizing how beautiful of a day it is i am truly am grateful to be apart of it im committed now to bettering myself in my deficits am getting the help i need and i am going to make the most of this opportunity to still be here i will not make the same near mistake again also for the hell of it here is a bonus video of my beloved dog i hope all of you are doing well and are okay reddit have a beautiful day,0

am just being unreasonable im a guy in the mid 30s had only a single relationship and intimacy partner so far and im almost literally dying to be close to a girl but through that relationship i learned a lot about myself which did not improved my already broken self image one thing is that i cant have a serious relationship with a girl i barely feel attracted to might sound like a nobrainer but i mean by character and looks character alone will just end badly because of the second problem there always will be a more attractive girl again maybe a nobrainer even if alone for statistical reasons but its still a problem withfor me no matter how attractive my girl would be eventually thered be a more attractive one stealing at least part of my attention intentionally or not but what i mean with this so far is just how i would end up feeling as far as attractiveness by looks go just because there is another girl which looks more attractive than mine doesnt mean id dare to drop or intentionally neglect her but i am also not that dense to think that everythings going to be fine if i end up fantasizing about another girl that just hurts no matter if its by being found out or just open about it having your so correctly guess it or incorrectly assume it its painful at least if not outright insulting regardless of being in control about those feelings or not so when i end up day dreaming again about having a cute girlfriend the spiral to hell goes down fast starting with my selfhate for being a hypocrite by wishing for a cute girlfriend while im at best just average looking then it steps up to how i deserve not even an equally average looking one for the reasons above and eventually i end up at the burnt in perception that im just a waste of space and resources which should never have come to existence so im wondering is my self image just broken or am i really just a fuck boy with depressions,1

the roots of fear fear is the expectation of displeasure in the widest sense in the narrowest sense fear is aversion of death every fear is fear of death fear is the expectation of unknown we fear only what is new what has become familiar to us loses the capacity to produce fear death too is to us the absolutely new and unknown for one should be able to die but once to be sure there are neurotics who die every day or at least play at dying man endures everything but not the unknown whose charactestic symbol is the dark faith fulfils a great mission by setting up a positive affirmation in place of the great question mark when a man fixed on any fearful idea life becomes hell and it feels no one understands what this man is dealing with all of us have been in fearful situations but some people are daily living this hell among the common fears people told me about fear of rejection is big when someone feels that no matter how he or she tries will be rejected so the person becomes his own rejecter and he always pull himself back fear of abandonment a person with this fear he or she always pushing away people for his life because he has doubts about why people interested in him and he has shame persona based fear of success theres some people no matter what effort they take they always fail because they fear being successful that means unconsciously to them success is bad and dangerous fear of intimate relationships a lot of people are dealing with sexual shame without being aware of that intimacy means pain and danger fear of oneself thats when a person is escaping himself all the time relying on drugs or some form of escapism such like porn working all the time gambling those are common fears that i find with my clients hope this post benefit you guys for any questions chat me peace sparkles,1

sometimes i wonder why i try thisll probably be a little different from the usual posts here but the result is the same i just find myself wondering why i fight at this point i feel like im surrounded by idiots that sounds conceited but i dont care anymore i try to reach a common viewpoint understand theirs and them understand mine but in the end its pointless you know i argued with a guy today who told me capitalism is bad because under capitalism the people are exploited by businesses he has prior to this told me how he does not pay bus fair because no one enforces it i brought this up to him and he of course simply ignored it meanwhile i feel like socially im just spinning my wheels i feel like im never truly improving im 26 and still have yet to really experience any kind of romantic relationship im more inclined to talk about myself not out of narcissism necessarily but rather because its all i can think to do to relate to people im a bit full of myself but ive earned that im smart and i save lives i do it as a volunteer and ill be further saving lives in nursing to that end im surrounded by idiots at college not the normal idiots the professors i had a stat professor once give me the wrong explanation of probability fractions he said that to find the probability of at least 1 id use the formula 1p1 1 minus the probability of 1 this is wrong i brought this to another professor of stat she gave me the write answer this man proceeded to explain to me in depth on the opposite side of this index card with the right answer why that was wrong during the test the answers were right but another question we all got right but were graded as getting it wrong we spent 30 minutes arguing for the right grade all this frustration and i fail out of nursing program on the second to last semester the dean was teaching though someone else was lecturing the dean however wrote the tests im 26 now i know given the time of day id pass with flying colors and make an excellent nurse however im now having to finish this and restart of course who cares anyone i tell that to will just tell me im not for the job never mind i discuss what i learned with doctors and nurses i know my shit not all of it but rather than teach they just blindly follow policy it is what it is you cant fight the system so adapt thats always been how i operate but at this point i wonder why i even bother i loved my time in the hospital for clinicals and i want nothing more than to continue to work there but why fight to go back whats the point of living a life where i am always fighting uphill for the bits of joy i can get i cant connect with anyone and when i do they ultimately stop talking to me even worse when someone is around i constantly think that im just blind to how annoyed they are by me im stuck between thinking im smart and thinking im an immature dolt ive spent years trying to work through all this but im left wondering what its all for whats the payoff will there even be a payoff i keep thinking if i work hard enough the enjoyable parts will begin to outnumber the miserable ones dont get me wrong there are days that are fun and those are great but it seems like i have to fight to get to them only to get knocked back is this all life is does it ever get to a point where i can enjoy more than i loathe i probably feel this way because im depressed its not 247 but i understand theres some kind of depression colloquially called walking depression who knows i wont get diagnosed i dont need a doctor to sit here and tell me what i already know heshe will outline treatment of course ssris tricyclics moais hell id probably feel better but i can do this on my own ive made it this far i just wish i could get assurance that im not wasting my time if this is as good as it gets i might as well kill myself now i could at least die remotely happy knowing every weekend has been a new adventure i died in my prime and i didnt spend decades fighting for an unattainable goal,1

im sick of this im so sick of this everything feels so numb and empty then randomly a huge wave of sadness hits i try to distract myself with work but i cant escape my hobbies are not fun anymore i want to learn new things but i have no motivation and every little thing frustrates me so much i am very curious and love to learn new things but its so hard with the brain fog feels like im actually getting more stupid everyday i hate it nothing is fun anymore everything is so exhausting sometimes i just want someone to hug me cuddle me and tell me that they love me but most of the time i want to go away from everyone and everything the news is depressing i am so tired of everything but still cant fall asleep at night i have lost all joy in my life i want to be me again i want to know how it feels to be happy again without taking drugs i am im my 20s shouldnt that be a great time in life a time where you look back when youre older and think of all the experiences you made wishing you were 20 again all i have in my 20s is depression anxiety and loneliness i cant believe my life has become so sad,1
i hate it when people say well occupy yourself when youre depressed people often say to take your mind off depression go do something play music focus on school etc but the issue is that these are all just blank substitutes that comes crashing down just as alcohol is a temporary fix although it is destructive using music exercise etc is just as pointless i work out and then i feel great and then afterwards i remember my situation and my life and i feel depressed again if its not resolved no amount of substitutes can help all these activities are are just temporary bandages on a wound that cant close edit wow i didnt expect this to get so many likes my first post with over 1k likes im happy to know that so many of you can relate with me in this way,1
is it just me but does depression go from 0100 ill be fine at one moment and then i just start feeling really down and all my inner demon voices start filling my thoughts for example last night i was watching a movie with my bf we decided to stay in order pizza have microwave popcorn and all that jazz but i noticed that he kept checking his phone and i started automatically assuming that hes probably flirting on ig i dont even have proof and my mood changed super quick i became sad and super insecure i feel like my retroactive jealously gets really bad at times too which leads to my depression i went to bed crying and woke up sad and angry feeling like im a piece of shit i hate it does anyone else suffer of mini episodes like this,1
why do nondepressed people think depression is about being sad all the time i dont feel sad i dont feel much actually if anything,1
does anyone have a period where they feel really motivated and see things clearly only to crash even harder the more you try to better yourself feeling even more depressed than you were originally it feels like the harder i try to better myself the harder it pushes back,1

being suicidal is like being at a terrible party being suicidal is like being on a really terrible night out im having a terrible time but my friends and family are all enjoying it so i stick around theyre the ones that invited me and said id have a good time but as time goes on the desire to leave just gets stronger and stronger so i try to distract myself by getting some more drinks to make it a bit more bearable but i still really just want to leave but everyone is telling me that this is a great night out to be on and that i should just stay and try to enjoy myself but im not enjoying myself im just numbing my annoyance at not being allowed to leave with drugs and alcohol ive got to the exit door a couple of times but i couldnt get any further than that whats more annoying is that while i can get help to make the night out more manageable im not allowed to just leave im stuck here it feels like this night out has just turned into a prison sentence,1
everytime i think positively something unexpected comes and spoils it as title really im going through a tough time within myself and my life at the moment but for years and years i came to realise that whenever i would look forward to something positive happening like trying to make a change or improvement something comes along and spoils it so i stopped being positive about things and instead tried to work towards it but in a much more suspicious way so for now for example im trying to find a new place to live seperating from wife and all seemingly good places i find are either snapped up too quickly or out of budget and im just so down and negative that i cant keep away from thinking positively this means that because im in a bad place i cant see myself getting out of it thinking of getting my life together just doesnt seem possible and i get down thinking that ill end up living a miserable loveless lonely boring life therefor depleting any drive i have to try ive essentially just given up regarding working hard for something good and settling for whatever life throws my way sleepyface,1
need to vent a bit hi all ive been feeling overwhelmed with my situation ive dug myself into huge debt due to horrible financial responsibility in my younger years along with continuous student loans and still not have gotten my degree after 5 years im on my last two semesters now at least i ended up going to school parttime and taking two jobs to try and chip away at my debt but the work has been very overwhelming and having to balance all of this is taking its toll on me i just wanted to vent my frustration to anyone who will listen life is tough but hopefully better days are coming,1
i just kissed for the first time at age 21 2 days ago i m21 had my first date ever with a young woman 20f we had been texting for 3 weeks and had called a few times so we already knew each other pretty well we met up and decided to stay in the car and get coffee as it was raining we parked in a quiet spot next to a river and talked while listening to music and drinking our coffee i then told her i really liked her and she said she did too we gazed at each others eyes and i looked down very briefly at her lips so did she we went for the kiss and made out for quite a while i was like that was nice and we dit it again she laid her head on my shoulder and the feeling that gave me was literally out of this world we decided to go for a little highway cruise while listening to music and talking and she held my hand the entire time i dropped her back off home after 2 hours and a half and we kissed twice again we hugged and she told me she didnt want to let go a month before this i felt like a total loser for never having even touched a girls hand and look at me now i feel like a million bucks i have a feeling she might soon be my first girlfriend too,0
after a few months i finally feel happy ive had a rough few months losing friends and feeling like a needed a change of scenery now ive shaken off my feelings of sadness got a new job and i couldnt be more excited for whats to come ive found hope with every day comes new challenges but i know ive got it currently listening to elton johns rocket man and its so comforting thought id share that here,0
i feel like im wasting my life being depressed i feel like im wasting my life being depressed i keep hearing give it time itll get better yeah maybe eventually itll get better and ill have wasted the better part of my young adulthood trying to figure out how to produce serotonin we only get one life and ive already spent a quarter of it feeling like shit i honestly hope reincarnation is true because if not then ive thoroughly wasted my one chance at a halfway decent life,1
had a really good day today and just wanted to share so where do i start this year has been rough from a failed coming out to covid to a life changing breakup while life has been pretty shitty for my mental health today was a sign of happiness living with my parents has been rough since ive been having to fake being straight and just hide being gay but today i got to see my amazing boyfriend and yes were both closeted and we met on grindr however despite it being hard for both of us we make it work and honestly ive never loved someone as much before ive never gotten happy over someone elses accomplishments before ive never loved someone no matter if they get a new tattoo or piercing but he changes all of that but back to today i was able to talk to my aunt who i havent seen in a while she doesnt know im gay but loves me a lot we was talking about moving out for me and we talked about how hard it will be for my parents but we finally both agreed that it kinda has to happen one day and whats a better time than now fast forward to a few hours later after i saw my bf i was talking to my dad about the idea and ive never mentioned it till now and was so worried because they hate the idea of me leaving them if it was up to them id live with them forever but he took it rather well i told him its not like id move far away legit just like 10 minutes away from our house and while he hated it he understood to an extent it just made me super happy because while its just a small step it gives me hope that one day ill be able to be truly happy and free my mom however thats gonna be a true battle but ill wait for another day for that if someone told me in march when i was not eating for weeks and just crying every night that id have an amazing boyfriend and an actual chance at being able to be an adult id think you was crazy there is hope and i hope everyone else has a great daynight thanks for reading if you did,0

stockpile of meds cw suicide hi ive honestly been suicidal for like 20 years i am 30 now i cant imagine a life where suicide isnt an option i cant imagine getting better i decided to be slightly more honest with my therapist and im going to be going for partial hospitalization soon so due to having many mental illnesses i have been on a lot of meds some of which were on a trial basis and i have kept them all i have enough of one particular med to kill myself i am not currently on this med and it is not useful to me in any way besides killing myself i cannot imagine myself ever willingly getting rid of my stash i obviously havent told my care team i have it ive had it since 2014 when i stopped that particular med it will still work even though its old like i feel like i need that out so whenif i get better do you think i would be willing to get rid of it honestly the thought of that is scary and makes me not want to get better i need the out i know there are other ways to go but this is the method i have chosen that i am most comfortable with for various reasons if im honest with my care team and tell them about it and that i refuse to get rid of it even though there have been a few times this month i was seriously considering using it will i be stuck in a hospital until i commit to throwing my stash away i know that by having it here i am in danger i dont care i need it i mean ive had it for years without using it so im pretty safe i think usually i am not even sure if its possible for me to get better i cant imagine a life without suicidal ideation i cant imagine not needing an out what do yall think,1
i had a personality once but now i cant remember who i am j remember i used to be funny i used to laugh and make jokes i remember being able to hold a conversation with people i wanted to know people and give back i was shy but querky talkative and funny around people who knew me now im nothing i dont seem to laugh or smile anymore i feel numb and unsatisfied with everything i do edit wow thank you everyone for your responses i thought this post would go unanswered honestly but its so comforting and reassuring to know that im not alone we just have to find the strength from somewhere to keep going on on a side note im not sure if anyone else feels like this but i sometimes think part of the reason is i have this intense fear of losing people so much in fact that i start believing in the values and hobbies of the people in my life in the hopes theyll like me and not leave i just agree and comply with everything ive done this for so long i just dont know who i am anymore,1
why cant i commit to anything i havent posted here in awhile i feel like ive taken 100 steps forward then completely fell on my face and rolled down a hill ive been working on getting an it certificate and i really want to put my all in it but when things get hard i tend to shutdown and get really depressed the voices in my head keep telling me to give up and im a failure im trying to accept that its ok to feel this way and progress is not a straight line but it feels like ive fallen so far im really close to giving up at this point i thought i would be really good at something like this because i love tech but i feel like im way outside of my league,1
memory loss from depression so recently my depression has hit a low point as i am in the middle of switching my meds since i saw a psychiatrist this week and she diagnosed me with severe depression and anxiety and is worried about me anywho my memory has been bad like i cant remember what i am doing sometimes or past 20 minutes of anything someone tells me can anyone else relate right now i dont know if its derealization but i just dont feel present i feel like i am alive but not here i cant remember anything and it is driving me crazy i would rather be sad unmotivated and depressed rather than suffering from memory loss,1
going outside and seeing people be actually happy makes me want to straightup break down and cry i hate leaving the house at this point especially in the late afternoon when all the kids seem to be out with their friends it reminds me of my own wasted childhoodteen years and how it couldve been me out there if i ever had a fucking chance why does everyone else naturally seem so happy while im over here fighting my brain for the bare minimum energy to do basic tasks like eat and shower fuck,1
advice needed i just broke down because of stress pretty much the title im a 22 year old dental hygiene student besides my study demanding a lot of time energy and effort it definitely doesnt help that i have to force myself to work extra because im broke another thing that doesnt help is that i havent seen my long distance partner in almost a year since this school year started ive been under non stop stress in november i felt like i was extremely close to a big breakdown and potentionally a burnout but i somehow managed to dodge that bullet since that ive been trying to fake it until i make it except its getting really hard now to pretend that everything is ok last semester i barely passed my exams which disappointed me i always aim to get good results and i get disappointed and feel guilty when i dont the last exams of this year are coming up next to that i have 5 other deadlines and an internship to finish all in 2 weeks time every morning i wake up in sheer panic trying to remember what day it is to get myself mentally prepared for deadline stress study stress work stress or performance stress sometimes a combination of two three or all of them i dont even know if this was the right place to post it but i had to let it out somewhere i dont feel comfortable opening up to my parents and my partner doesnt seem to understand me very much when it comes to these type of things if anyone has experienced something similar or has an idea of something i could try that could potentially help me get through the upcoming 2 weeks of hell id love to hear it thanks for even taking a few minutes out of your day to read my venting post its very much appreciated,1

no one showed i should have expected that ive only ever had one friend in my life ive tried to make more but people hate me ive gone to community events parties hobby shopsetc to meet people people just dont seem to click with me im seen as odd annoying weird to name a few things ive been called the only person i can call a friend is my wife and i still do not understand how that came along she just gave me a chance and looked at my oddities a little different earlier this year my wife discovered i have never had a birthday party i never really had any friends to have a party so i just never tried to have one she said that was an injustice and i should have a party and invite friends from facebook she decided to throw me a party a few weeks ago we planned it out for a month made all the decorations by hand hand cooked all the snacks and food even made our own party games to play sent out invitations to people on my facebook her friends we even got rsvps back it all seemed like my first birthday party would be fun i was hopeful coming up on the day then the day of the party happened we rushed to get it all finished before the party start and we were excited the party start time came and 30 minutes later no one was here no big problem everyone always comes to a party late 2 hours later still no one came i started to eat my snacks by myself we got various excuses throughout the night i got sick stuff has come up car isnt starting no babysitters my boss just called me in my wife went to bed early she was upset and mad i told her its ok i am strong outwardly for her i dont want her to feel bad no one likes me but i am being eaten up alive i am now in my 30s and i cant ever said ive had a true friend other than my wife of course im thankful she gave me a chance i dont know what is wrong with me or why i seem to be broken i never should have had this party because ever since then i just cant get it out of my head everyone time i would say outloud to my wife or family they would tell me dont say that plenty of people are your friends youre just being negative now my wife truly sees what i mean if i would have just told my wife no to the party she wouldnt have been upset and id still be ignoring the problem of me being friendless edit everyone thank you for all of the birthday wishes trying to get through replies and messages didnt expect this many messages thank you all again edit 2 i see a lot of messages telling me to be thankful for my wife i am very thankful for her she is the best thing that has ever happened in my life and im the best that ever happened in hers we have been through everything together even homelessness that being said i feel as if she isnt enough socially for me we are 2 different people and even though we share a lot of interests we do not share all of them sometimes it is nice to have other friends to share your other interests with too example she hates the show its always sunny in philadelphia she hates it to a point that if i watch it it should be on my pc with headphones so she doesnt need to hear it i do it because i can understand it frustrates her but i love the jokes so much and i see random stuff in the world and laugh because it reminds me of iasip but i have no one to share it with except the subreddit,1
how was i a straight a student i just realized something while doing homework for my duel enrollment course i saw my banner that my school gave me it says scholar 40 gpa i dont understand how i did that i just remember feeling lifeless through those years because i had no social life i definitely wasnt smart now i cant seem to keep up with me classes its so exhausting and i also dont try i dont think ill get back those scholar habits i make such bad impressions on my teachers now im not the same person i was before i had depression,1
the scary part about having depression is when you start to feel down its hard to know if its a temporary reaction to life or the start of a relapse basically what the title says and my current situation,1
zero appetite am i the only one who had basically no appetite when im stressed it quite literally makes me sick to eat when im stressed or anxious or depressed or any combination of those i figure i need to eat but i cannot bring myself to eat what does everyone else do when this happens am i alone in this phenomenon,1
posting again my heart rate been 120 i think im having a bad bout of anxiety how long does your high heart rate last for mine has been hours also whenever i move or turn it races,1
i dont think this is depression but it sure feels like it hello i am in a weird situation right now and i dont really know who to talk to about it or anything so i am hoping i might get some help or support here ive had bad depression years ago after my sister passed i could not be happy no matter what i talked to my doctor who convinced me to go to a psych ward in a hospital i am sure it was precautionary and meant to be helpful but it was more annoying than anything i had no inclination to self harm was stuck in a boring and sometimes scary place for 12 hours to finally be discharged by a psychologist at 2am meanwhile my husband is crying at home i felt a little played i was on antidepressants for about a year and then got through the depression thing have been great since then but about a month ago i noticed a change it happened when i got back from vacation my anniversary is on the 25th and my birthday is the 26th so my husband and i took a vacation that week it was fun busy but when i got back to the normal routine i just dont have the desire to do anything anymore i used to play games on my computer for hours now i just kind of sit here i would find a ton of things to do while working now i dont really want to do anything when my husband would be at work i would try learning to mod a game or when he was home we would watch tv and stuff i still do that but have no interest to do anything else i am still happy at least with my husband i still look at memes and laugh i still love hanging with my dogs but i am just not interested in anything else this was different from my last depressive episode but feels pretty similar except before i didnt find almost any interest in anything while now i kind of dont want to do anything especially alone i hope this is making sense i dont know if this is depression again but not a typical depression last time i had depression my doctor suspected a big vitamin d deficiency i had at the time so maybe it is something similar i have adhd and was off my usual routine for over a week maybe there is a resistance to the drugs and i am searching for a dopamine hit i dont know but it is frustrating and i cant seem to get out of the funk of whatever it is for the last month,1
im so fucking depressed it took me three days to find the strength to microwave an instant meal ive been eating like maybe three mini donuts per day for about three days because i can barely get out of bed ive been hungry the whole time but like i just dont care that much i finally found the energy to microwave something so here goes i miss warm food i fucking hate this disease,1
its so bland i used to journal a lot especially about my dreams because they were always so interesting i read books while eating meals at home and could go through three in a month i had regular piano lessons and played piano every single day for years all those are gone im trying to recover some sense of exercise and i feel like im succeeding there but im having a hard time with everything else i know i want to get back to those things i really do but its so hard has anyone here managed to recover any of their hobbies,1
using sex as a way to get a break from depression i know it isnt the healthiest choice but after trying 3 different antidepression meds its the only thing that works i just cant stand how numb they make me feel,1
im under so much stress its triggering my seizures lately i feel like i wanna run away and delete all social media and just completely reinvent myself i know its an irrational thought cause i have a great life and a fantastic partner who takes care of me and gives me everything i could ever ask for im having so much self internalized crisis that its triggering my seizures i took a kolonopin last night and it helped a lot but this morning i had another seizure i have to go to work right now and im a hairstylist so im worried about being over stressed at work and having one in front of a client or while im doing hair but im worried of telling my employer because i dont want to be an inconvenience i wish i could just disappear,1
if someone could help me out after having read my rent i would he grateful and if not thats fine as well hello people my life feels at this moment worthless i wouldnt mind someone taking it away at least having said that thats out of the way school started again in my final year now i turned 18 the beginning of the end of school but because of complications mental health i had to redo a year a while ago all my friends have left now and i feel very stuck and alone everywhere in school with my family im not the person i was during my vacation ive changed again to the back old stressed and scared me and i hate it its hard because i just dont want any people around me yet i also feel the need for someone but i cant bring up the motivation or will power to do so and im in this constant state of not really being there i dont see any way how to build up a friendship with someone i see at school for example while i definitely need such a thing everyone seems so not on the same level and i think well thats not gonna work out besides that minor stuff stresses me im no longer mindful in any way i feel so god damn hopeless and so scared for the future so immense scared that ill fuck up i cant even go to bed simply because every part in my brain wants to stay awake no matter how tired i am i try to stay awake until i cant no more because ive no motivation to fall asleep and start the day over again i really dont know what to do at this point im still on a waiting list for therapy and as it seems it will for sure take another month if im lucky most likely 3 months everything in me just surches for escapes its sleep deprivation or i grab alcohol while i pledged to not drink i can be way more impulsive than normally its weird all this combined with moments of derealization i dont know what is going on with me the last weeks but ill not be able to continue in this way i feel a stranger in my own body in this world with everyone could someone please explain me why this all happens and what could help or yeah i dont really know i dont even know if this is the right place for this post,1
depression fucking sucks thats it,1
am i just being melodramatic to feel like you shouldnt tell someone how they should be coping with their mental healthgrieftrauma unless youve been through the same thing the thing is i would say half the time when im having a mental health crisis its probably quite easy for other people to see that im struggling i can be quite vocal about how im feeling as sometimes i feel like its better to be brutally honest about how youre feeling rather than to not say anything but the other half of the time when im having a mental health crisis tbh it kind of scares me in a way because what happens is that i bottle all my struggles and emotions up then ill have a breakdown or a fit of emotional burnoutanger but most of the time this happens when im in my bedroom with the door shut so obviously no one else is going to know that ive had a breakdown because its happened behind closed doors i wouldnt say im naturally an irritable or easily angered person but when someone bottles up their emotions everyone will explode with a different emotion for me its usually sadness and anger anger for having a breakdown because it makes me feel weak and sad because it feels like this is a vicious cycle because i bottle my emotions up then i get more and more tetchy then i explode then i feel like ive fucked up because i clearly cant control my emotions very well then i feel guilty that other people can control their emotions better than i can,1
cant eat anyone else struggle to eat when stressed im one of those people even the thought of food can make me nauseous if im really stressed trying to make myself eat it can often result in puking ive been on extremely high stress the last few days and i am hardcore struggling to get food down does anyone else have this issue how do you manage it im fine with fluids just actual food is the problem,1

suffering too much to bear im pretty sure i have depression i dont have friends ive always been excluded ive never dated a girl i havent kissed or anything im 27 years old yesterday was the worst birthday of my life whenever it seems like its going to get better the suffering comes back i may be mistaken but it seems that some people are disgusted with me they look at me and treat me strangely its been four times and twice in the last few days the happiest moment of my life involves games when i got it something very very difficult not people moments i wanted this hell to endbut i dont have the courage to kill myselfi cant imagine having a normal life my youth is passing and i didnt enjoy anything in life i just exist,1
repressed rage stress and sadness taking its toll no idea what to do please help over the last few years i have had a lot of built up rage stress and sadness mostly due to school with getting bullied and not having any friends but also due to the fact that im not doing well in school as well because i am lazy its been taking its toll on me sometimes my hands shake because of it sometimes i dont get mad at large things at all and either repress it or not care about it but also cry and get angry at myself and others over relatively small things half the time i feel relatively happy making jokes to myself and the other half of the time i feel like a complete wreck and waste i have no idea what to do with myself the last time i went out to see people i broke down in tears and couldnt go i also dont have friends because i dont trust people this is because when i went to school everything was alright at first but when i started getting bullied all of my friends just vanished i have no idea what to do,1
i dont feel like im suicidal enough to warrant help but at the same time every time i do feel suicidal it hits me like a ton of fucking bricks like right now my heart is telling me to go jump off the fire escape the scene keeps replaying in my head while i lie in bed motionless and numb i feel like a fake depressed person because i avoid my responsibilities and just play video games or do anything meaningless to fill time it just makes me feel like a lazy person and i often think im just using my depression as an excuse to feel lazy and that i deserve the suicidal thoughts i want to admit myself to inpatient but again i feel like id just be taking up space as a fake depressed person even though sometimes i really cant stop thinking or fantasizing about killing myself i just dont want to experience the stress of school anymore i lost all my friends im also scared of leaving my partner to fend for themselves and i dont know if my school would even permit a leave of absence anyways also covid of course every time i think about or try to do homework my brain goes into suicide mode even though i love learning and what i learn about im so far behind in my classes because maybe im just lazy and not actually depressed i dont know its not like anyone will see this i just need to talk about it i feel so nauseous small edit i went to sleep last night and am only now checking reddit after class and i im so blown away by the supportive responses and the support offers ive gotten when i said i thought no one would see this i genuinely meant it and so to be able to read everyones comments even the ones of people who are in the same spot it has given me more hope i feel so warm and fuzzy inside i felt i had lost all my friends to my depression and i havent felt this feeling in my chest in a while and i cant overstate how flattered i am i would cry if i could im gonna try to reply to people you all really helped me last night and today i woke up and its a bright sunny day i can hear the cars and the people outside im still sad and unstable but i feel hope in my chest so thank you really whiteheart,1
is this stress related so im in the process of buying things for my new apartment its my first time moving and i will admit it has been just a tad bit stressful these last two nights i woke up with one sided painful headaches could this be due to overthinking and keeping stress within me i dont typically get these headaches while sleepingwaking up thanks,1
how much alcohol does it take to numb pain i took a bunch of my parents alcohol im 20 for reference i really wanted to die but i have a little brother and i would feel bad if i killed myself or even started a new life i have a bunch of 50 ml 40 volume 80 proof tequila bottles i weigh about 190lbs im a woman and i dont necessarily want to get drunk i just want to be able to study without my depressing thoughts getting in the way how much until i can function on zombie mode edit was misled by popular tv into believing alcohol numbs the pain turns out this is false,1
nobody cares if youre happy or not they just want you to function thats what i realized today,1
depression ugly shy socially awkward quiet social anxiety is one of the worst feelings not to mention all the invalidation no one is ugly man i wish i could stop caring so much about attractive women makes me sad to see them no one will want my ugly boring ass i know someone will say just focus on urself bro lifes fun,1
i feel like i cant connect with people anymore i spent so much time on my own scared to trust people and just doing my thing whenever i hang out with people i get sick of socializing super quickly like a shitty battery running out i go on dates with guys who are very into me but im never into them i never know what to say i would rather stare at a wall for an hour than try to carry a convo with a stranger then i feel shitty about myself for letting them down its not like id make a decent girlfriend anyway feels like ill never meet someone i will like spending time with i just wanna go home and do stuff alone i always thought i didnt have friends cause i hate myself but i think i hate other people even more edit wow this blew up i never expected that so many people felt the same i feel a little bit less alone now i also feel sad for all of you knowing were all going through the same pain 3,1
feeling stressed i am a healthcare worker and i only moved to my current city last year i dont have many friends here aside from work friends and a couple friends i met through my boyfriend lately i have felt an overwhelming sense of anxiety and stress it seems like everyone around me does not care anymore that there is a pandemic going on with this back and forth of restrictions and uncertainties many people seem to just be so sick of it and have started to ignore the restrictions and hanging out as normal working in healthcare especially as a frontline worker i have a hard time doing that i certainly dont want to be the person to be a super spreader since i work at multiple sites they typically have gatherings that involve drinking and ending up indoors i feel like such a prude for wanting to follow the guidelines and just have outdoor gatherings so i dont end up going i wish i had some friends who are still taking precautions i understand that it seems like the light at the end of the tunnel seems to be just a glimmer these days but if people stop caring now wont that just drag things out its not fair that this just prolongs the suffering for those who are actually being careful feeling overwhelmingly alone in this lately,1
feel like im at breaking point sometimes my whole life is a mess i am abused by my narcissist parents who i am also fulltime carer for which makes it all worse no i cant leave or get other carers in please just accept that you dont know the whole situation thank you my sister married 2 kids never even offers to go grocery shopping she drives i dont for them and when i say to my parents they should ask for her help they dont want to bother her yet they fawn over how amazing and hard working she is i get called lazy cos i quit my job to scrounge government money using their disability as an excuse they dont refer to me as their daughter they call me their carer they treat me like a maid like staff yet when my sister does help its with things my parents have refused to let me do so then they come round on sunday do the thing and i feel like it makes me look so lazy then when i make a point you said no when i offered to do that i feel petty some bg on my sister never got beaten by mom i did never left me alone with her kids i got to change one diaper when they were babies refused to teach me how to drive never calls me or invites me to her house gives me the general impression she doesnt want me around my mental health has never been great but lately i am just crumbling into a state of nonexistence i have no desire to shower brush my hair even change my clothes because of my mental health i forget all birthdays and events and never have the money to give them unless i go without food to do so they say its fine but i get that look you know the look that oh heres the family fuck up again kind of look i drink daily not loads just every evening i drink low alcohol wine this brings on the binge eating which makes me feel sick sometimes i am sick due to care work i cant take days off or breaks due to lack of support this is even less possible im sorry this is all over the place i just dont know what to do i hate my life i hate myself and who i have become this isnt me i used to be so happy life of the party i used to dress up and feel pretty i look so fat stressed and tired i loathe catching my reflection these days i just hate myself been to doctors twice different ones they dont give a shit one laughed at me the other said i dont ahve time for your life story and just shoved tablets under my nose offering me free counselling which doesnt work i need a therapist not someone to nod at me and ask how i feel about that,1
ever look back on your life and just wonder what happened to you i used to be so outgoing and carefree i was content with myself because i didnt really have the capacity at that point to dislike myself at all like i didnt really know what that was and i hadnt really lived much of life at that point to have developed anxiety and other issues i didnt overanalyse and overthink i actually used to walk about without this constant pit feeling in my stomach and without anxiety filling up my chest all the time i genuinely used to be fine and now im not so much if i sit for a while and actually genuinely think about how i physically and emotionally felt and think about my past perception of the world it is so different from how i feel now and occasionally ill get a fleeting feeling that reminds me of the contentedness i had when i was younger but it never stays and it makes me so sad edit holy upvotes thanks for the awards and also sharing your feelings with me its nice to know people are experiencing the same thing,1
i wish my mom wasnt alive so i dont have to feel bad about commiting suicide i believe suicide is a very selfish thing considering the pain it brings to those around you and those having to take care of your remains after etc but i honestly wish my mom wasnt around so that i could kill myself without devastating her ive thought about ways of suicide that will lead the least amount of sorrow to my mom because i love her i honestly think it would be better to make it look like an accident that way she will not have as much guilt something like going on a canoe tripby myself lol take some opioids and sleeping pills and drown myself idk im so lonely and burnt out on life right now,1

what about the rest of us those who have a heart and actually care for others those who are willing to give people the benefit of the doubt some of us actually care about you yes you stranger reading this those of us who understand struggle realize that it doesnt have to be just on your shoulders as long as you and i respect each other i have no reason to hate you dislike you want the worst for you take advantage of you id rather be your good friend explore the wonders of the world with a smile with you drink a beer with you get hammered and have the craziest night with you ride with you swim with you cry with you have a wonderful night with you why are there so many women and men out there who want to take advantage of others treat each other better be better and life will be easier and more satisfying,0
my brother thinks the way i deal with my stress is cool so for the longest time ive dealt with my stress by scratching and picking at my skin this obviously causes me to have a lot of wounds and scars and i hate them i always cover them up with hoodies and long pants which is terrible because where i live it is super warm and overall its not the best experience my brother recently got a bunch of circular wounds on his arm i immediately recognized that they were because of scratching because all my wounds are circular too i asked him why he scratched at his skin and told him about how i hate my skin because i do it and i cant stop and he replied with its because of stress but i know that its not the case because he never did this before i told him how i scratch my skin i believe its because he thinks having all these bleeding cuts and scratches is cool and he wants to show his friends that hes tough and other things like that how should i deal with this and help him and myself stop doing this its not healthy and i feel really guilty when i look at his arms and i know sooner or later he will get them all over tldr i always scratched my skin because of stress and after telling my brother about it because its a problem i face he started doing it too i feel really guilty,1
an unexpected side effect of depression the decline of cognitive capabilities this has been really scaring me lately since becoming depressed ive noticed more and more an inability to maintain thoughtful conversations with people severely reduced attention span short term memory loss severely reduced motivation i think it largely has to do with my partaking in escapism as i spend much more time browsing reddityoutube and getting high since when i actually try to focus on work i usually end up crying the result seems to be a feeling like ive been living in a haze like im never really fully aware of whats going on im just passively going through the motions of life getting out of this rut is going to be so much harder than i thought i literally feel stupider now that ive been depressed for months i can barely even talk to people in my classes now they seem so competent and on top of things while im just an embarrassment who can barely form a coherent sentence,1
stop asking me where i see myself in 5 years what i want to do later what are my projects i hate lying where do you see yourself in 5 years what do you want to do later what are your projects i hate these questions because i cant see any lights in my future only pain stupidity and failure when people tell me these questions i just look at them stupidly because i cant reply in a grave or maybe in a river maybe the streets i have no idea these questions hurts because it make me realize how much a failure i am and how meaningless and absurd life is i dont know i wish i knew what i want to do but i dont know i just want to stop this mess,1
yep ive officially lost my mind ive done irreversible damage now basically im 31 and have a weird fucking relationship with my multi millionaire parents where they will help me survive if im on the edge of death but not actually help me thrive its been this way forever i am not trying to sound like a petulant manchild although i get it if you see it that way im homeless right now but my dad lets me sleep in his workshop in the middle of town ive been here 2 months since i left a sober living where i had a 20 yo felon as a roommate that was always threatening me ive drank on and off tonight is on and i have an extreme rage towards my parents words wont do it justice but my mother is a narcissist karen at levels you cant comprehend ive developed anger issues in the past few months after having maintained a relatively calm and cool demeanor through all the bullshit well tonight i am just done i guess i scribbled thatll be the last car you ever own something my dad said to me when i decided to sell my car when i was struggling financially behind a plaque hanging on the wall i have punched a small hole in the bathroom wall i put a few small cuts on my wrist because im too much a pussy to go deeper and just fucking die but ive left a blood soaked napkin on the table next to his switchblade i am done i am done living this life i am ready to commit suicide i just need one more thing to go wrong,1
tragic surprises of loneliness its hard to be strong and easy to fall in a hole here is how it feels right now with the urgent life changes of immediacy and intrinsic relationship of losing your rock your life balance and the one you love they are still here so close yet so far i wrote something that is really how it feels right now and layers of years of depression and avoidance has led to this day you know when the electricity goes out unexpectedly you scramble to try and find your way around the dark hit walls and seek the shelter of other companionship regardless of the irrational fear of the dark human nature is to pull together in the center of the home i feel like i have had the electricity shut off running around looking for the human connection my family my wife my loves kids no time to adjust no time to prepare just lights out i seek to find them and say its going to be okay and the electricity will be restored soon however no matter how much i look i cant seem to find anyone around lost darkness and longing for the connections i have lost yet i can hear them i can see them but they are so far away im really struggling in so many ways trying to write my feelings a bit more so i can be more aware of them but the awareness brings so much more pain,1
im not fit for life im not hard working failed out of school im stupid as fuck i dont have an ounce of charisma like talking to a brick wall i look like garbage i have no interests or talents not good at anything good for nothing i only see myself as someone to lift boxes or take orders thats it im not someone worth knowing,1
sometimes i dont care if i wake up again or not why would i itd just be another day of people screaming at me and feeling like shit because of everything i cant do then its 2am again everything reminds me that im alone in the world and itll always be like that because who the fuck would be with someone like me itd just be another day of me thinking how my life would be if someone loved me id finally be so happyi wouldnt be alone anymore id finally have someone that loves mejust imagine me having someone that does want to talk to me that wants to spend his life with me too andand were happy together but on the inside i just know it wont happeni justi know it sometimes i wish i was strong enough to just kill myself but i cant even do that i wish it stopped hurting,1
i was crying today when my kitten was lying in bed with me she saw i was crying and she licked my tears i feel so blessed to have her just started crying more but this time from happiness just wanted to share what happened we could do with some more positivity in here ive only had my kitten for 4 days and i love her with all my heart she makes me feel so much better and reduces my panic attacks she heals my heart 3,0
i wish i had never been born i dont want to exist i didnt ask for this life is horrible and it never gets better only pain and just when you think youre in the most pain possible surprise you find out about a whole new level of pain you had no idea existed i remember being 21 feeling excited about the future and thinking things were only going to get better from there how stupid and naive i was im not sure if im depressed or just finally understand the reality of life or both maybe happiness is so hard to find and always ends up being taken away,1
i envy people who passed away in their sleep i wish that was me most of them probably didnt wish to die in their sleep but id wish that happen to me,1
college like remember how we all picked our college major based on something we kinda liked in high school and like everything was ok until you started getting really depressed and now you like dont want to do your major anymore cause youre a stem major and like you have a lot of work but like sleeping and never leaving your dorm sounds better and like even tho you love your major youre just so stressed and like wanna switch to something easier like psych or english and then you realize you hate that too and finals are this week and orgo is a pain in the ass and like youre panicking cause you could lose your scholarship if you dont agree to continue research next semester cause you were short 2 credits last year cause you had to go to the hospital cause like same,1

kinda finally getting the thai teenager experience ummm so im not sure what to put in the title because its kinda complicated but i guess what i said works just a warning that this gonna be a long post also lol lately ive been making so many new friends local friends i didnt have a lot of local friends previously people from my country as i has to cut off people from my old school and now i am not inside my countrys education system either most of my friends are overseas my bestfriends are almost 13000 miles away ive always wanted to have people i could go hangout with people with the same timezone to hangout with people to talk about shit going on here not ones that i am just explaining the whole situation to but one that shares an experience ive first met this friend through a facebook group i had a post that went viral and he added me he then commissioned my art i then found out were the same age and like a lot of things in common i was really happy to have a new local friend he also let me send him happy mail and i made him a rick roll card then i joined his discord server and got to meet his classmates his friends are really nice to me so we soon became friends too i send them happy mail i help them cheat on their online exams and their english homework we have now talked about maybe hanging out at the amusement park when covid gets better my friend says that im like the unofficial 46th student of their class because of how much i interact with everyone i feel so accepted its so nice then i met my friends other friend it was actually just a day ago we hung out and talked on call and it was so fun i asked if i could send him mail too and he was really enthusiastic and told me i can send as much as i want and he will keep a collection then this new friend introduced me to his gf and shes likes stationery she was so excited when i told her i do snail mail she said she had never done it before and would love to write with me i was really scared that i would somehow not be able to hangout with these people because of what happened in the past but now im literally doing nothing but being myself and i am making so many friends i just feel so fucking happy rn i am making so many new friends i will get to use thai language more i could probably even hangout with them in my country now they actually all live in a different province from me so its not like i can see them all the time but its not super difficult to meet them either im so excited i feel like i am finally getting the chance to experience a life of a teenager in thailand i thought i wouldnt have a chance as im about to not be a teenage very soon i have voice calls and video calls to be in all day like ive always dreamed of people are enthusiastic at what i do and i dont have to only care about what they like it makes me feel so fucking full inside im bursting with joy i know this post was quite long and i maybe didnt even make that much sense but thank you so much for listening to me also if anyone wants to know what happened about my old friends i can tell you but only via a letter lol i just really like to write letters so i had to say that lmao,0
anxiety makes depression worse so i have anxiety mild to moderate about shit like climate change and death and it makes me depressed and question my existence it hurts to think about all this also i think im bipolar idk i sometimes wake up feeling happy and not having any problems and most days i wake up and feel extremely depressed i withdraw from brothers sometimes lost quite a bit of interest over activities i frequently enjoyed and always feel tired and always have hard time falling asleep which frequently leads to staying up all night,1

devastated why do people say shit like that they like you or that in my case specifically they want all of you even the bad only to dissappear after you have been vulnerable to them i hate my life i hate myself im pissed that i told this man i liked deeply so much about me even though were only online and he lives in another country he constantly disappears for days at a time after he said he wouldnt do that anymore hell only talk to me on kik im 33 i cant believe i fell for the same lines youd think id learn i hate everything,1
i want off this world thought maybe i would have my life back on track by now at least that was the plan 5 years ago hardest thing is getting up every morning knowing i have a list of things to do in x amount of time doesnt motivate me like i wish it would every day is a constant reminder of things i fail at or fall short to finish i dont feel alone reading this subreddit and yet that doesnt give me solace,1
what do i do when i feel like i dont belong anywhere anymore sometimes i just feel like i dont belong here anymore what do i do if i think i might not make it past the next few years,1
just because someone has it worse doesnt make your pain unjustified i hate when people say something along the lines of this guy got through this so youll be fine when someone is going through tough times in their lives that is the last thing theyd want to hear it makes me feel like shit and im sure its the same for them its toxic and it wont make someone whos depressed feel any better if not worse think of it as being stabbed by a knife hurts as much as being stabbed by a sword just because the blades smaller doesnt mean it doesnt hurt the only reason im posting it here is because i hear this toxic shit everywhere i get it if they are trying to comfort you and they dont know what to say but i would think theyd understand it wouldnt make it any better just because some other guy had it worse while yes it can bring someone whos whining about something trivial to perspective theres a line thats crossed when you tell something like that to someone whos actually going through depressiontough times it only makes me feel worse when i hear this so if you are going through depressiontough times how would you respond to this i honestly dont know how and it makes me feel like shit and that me having gone through depression was something meaningless,1
im overwhelmed i think i have too many things going on maybe idk im struggling to manage it all im a 3rd year engineering student but i am only in 4 courses at the moment the courses are interesting and i enjoy them but i really struggle to be motivated to study i used to care now i expect to fail despite being perfectly capable of achieving high grades and wanting those grades i live with my bf who is currently immigrating into canada via spousal sponsorship enter a mound of paperwork that is proving to be really challenging its stressful because i have to be on him to get it done he wants to immigrate but is held back by his own insecurities things only seem to move forward when i blow up at him which ive done recently so he is doing his bit now problem is my bit of the paperwork is now overwhelming me because when you have moved 21 times and worked 8 jobs the questions where have you lived in the past 5 years and state your employment history for the last 5 years become extremely tedious i have a job lined up for when i finish this semester in may im excited for it but they havent told me where i will be anywhere in canada or what i will be doing yet so thats a lingering worry i also need to find another job to start in september i need to buy a car my job has a 99 chance of requiring one my parents will pay for it yes i know i am incredibly lucky and priviledged and im really thankful to them for being so generous thing is i have no clue how to buy a car they are willing to spend up to 10k on it aiming for the 68k range and i am terrified to drop so much money on a something that i am so inexperienced in purchasing also i have a month and a bit to buy it my brother will be living with me and my bf next year starting sept 2020 i need to show him the ropes on how to adult im really excites but also scared because i tend to become mom 2 in these scenarios and that is really not what he needs also the process of accelerating his schooling and getting him into uni he is 16 compressing high school into 1 year is heavily reliant on my knowledge of both high school and university and my ability to contact people here at the uni this is not even mentioning his course load which i have decided i just cant help him with because i have too much going on im trying to balance my life i want to spend time with my bf brother and friends but also not completely flop my classes i want to do fun things but am scared to thing is im so unproductive when i study im slow i get 1 hour of work done in an entire day no matter what i try everyone says to exercise but thats just another thing on the todo list that never gets done also i will not be converted to any kind of mindfullness im done with all types of religions im so overwhelmed and frustrated oh and my taxes are due and i have no clue how to do them tldr i am a young adult that is new to basic things like buying a car and doing taxes i am overwhelmed by the amount of variables and choices around me and frustrated because i cant seem to be productive,1
i hate that nobody can understand what trauma does to you and this compounds the depression not only is childhood trauma one in which your parents who should have represented all that was good were in fact evil one of the worst possible causes of depression but the fact that nobody gives two shits other than telling you get over it or seek help as if trauma is expected but not ignoring it is not expected youre supposed to conform to this place to accept trauma as normal if not something you do normally and so you get even more depressed about the fact that nobody understands what its like to be depressed,1
i dont want to kill myself i just dont want to exist my life feels to be falling apart i dont know how to explain it other than my limbs all being stretched and physically unraveling and dislodging my brain is rot and my insides are rot rotted goop i dont have a purpose in life i have no dreams in life im wasting away the prime of my life i dive into my eating disorder to cope and get high sometimes and selfharm therapy for me of 3 years failed and my therapist took an indefinite leave so that went down the drain my psychiatrist is cool but ive tried 15 meds and nothing really works i cant figure out this big issue in my life and i repeatedly obsess and ruminate over it with no answers or solutions as i sit paralyzed in fear i think i just realized today that my depression has been getting worse in ways i didnt recognize as ive gone up on this new medication talking to people has become more of a chore than it used to be it gets on my nerves to have to speak up or when anyone talks to me i dont care to talk about anything im interested in anymore i used to at least have some interest in certain topics but now i just dont care and i dont want to talk to anyone every word said to me or that i say is a fork on a chalkboard i have to psych myself up to raise my voice and speak i dont care about doing things i used to do with friends well i care less anyway or more like im just indifferent numbed out i still care but it doesnt feel asthere it feels like im wearing emotioncanceling headphones its all still there but its so muted i cant stay awake during the day at work at all worse now than before i find myself seeming to play less with my wonderful pets ive lost credibility at work and plateaued with my ability and i just dont care anymore it makes me feel bad but i dont care enough to do anything about it at all i realize i suck at my work but so what ive already failed i still fail so what my motivation was already shit but now its more like i dont care i used to be upset that my motivation was gone angry about it in a sense and now i kind of just dont give a shit i recognize that my motivation is still gone and sure its still upsetting but not as upsetting as it was because i dont feel the anger at myself as much occasionally i have bursts of extreme emotion like yesterday i had a major anger rage moment where i had to take anti anxiety meds to even remotely start to calm down after a period of screaming slamming things around and knocking things over and selfharming viciously in a frenzy some days i burst into tears for all night and just keep a rag with me to soak up the tears as the time passes and i try to do things that fall within my normal schedule and small range of activities i do once i go home from work every day is a repeat of the day before week by week all the same its monday then suddenly friday then the weekend then mondayrepeat i dont care about any of it monday wednesday sundaywhatever all the same the best part of my day is when i get to come home from work and have a binge and purge episode for like 23 hours thats literally the most i look forward to and even that is starting to fade out everything is faded everything is muted at random times i explode but then the monotony sets back in and i find myself almost in a stupor of some kind my life is meaningless and i want it to be over i dont want to commit suicide i just want to not exist,1
ive been left out of everything and someone actually cared so basically my school is crap teachers dont care about me being left out or bullied half of my time here i didnt think the students did until today there was an odd number of girls today since one was off and we had to go into pairs of course none wanted to go with me and neither did any one of the boys so i sat at the side and said i was fine not doing it however one of the boys asked why i couldnt go in a three with one of the girls pairs if you couldnt tell im female and in my school girls and boys dont like to go together much but all of them said no this is a paired activity so he actually got really mad and called them all assholes and said how he noticed how they all treat me like shit and asked if i wanted to go in his pair he got a detention just at lunch break for swearing in front of the teacher and multiple small children passing by but it honestly warmed my heart so much and it showed me that maybe there is some good left in humanity and that someone actually cares it was the first time id felt happy in a long time to be honest,0

the day i truly felt like i became a dad so to offer some background i took up the responsibility of becoming a single parent last year i had contemplated taking in an older kid not only because i thought i could at least leave them alone during the day when i was at work but also because i knew how often older kids get passed up in the system for babies toddlers and young kids and after getting in touch with my agency i eventually found out about a kid that was actually my neighbor at one point having lived in the same apartment building as me she lived three doors down from me and i remember chatting with her casually a few times because she would just hang out outside her apartment every day i had no idea she was the victim of abuse from her mother and felt terrible i remember the day her social worker introduced me to her i had to remind her of our interactions and once she remembered she had the biggest smile on her face once i took her in and i spent the first week home with her it went fairly well there were some bad habits i had to help break like she used to swear casually just thought it was normal and some other small things but we got over it over the proceeding months and shes been good ever since i trust and love her and she trusts and loves me so the event in question happened about two months ago i was going to be gone for a business trip for about three weeks and had to leave my daughter with my brother and my niece and nephew she didnt mind staying with them but was understandably upset at the idea of me being gone for so long she wasnt having a breakdown or anything just kind of forlorn and sullen it broke my heart seeing her like that but i made sure to make our last night together as memorable as possible and stayed up way later than i should have just for her sake the next morning i left and it took every fiber of my being to step outside and leave but somehow i did i kept in touch with her and my sister regularly just to make sure everything was going well needless to say i hated being gone and wanted nothing more than to hop back in my car and go home the thing i left for was so needlessly boring and tedious beyond imagining i mean sure i liked being with my coworkers and meeting new people but i would rather be elsewhere of course somehow i got through it though and woke up extremely early the next morning and put petal to the metal to get home dont worry i slept enough and wasnt tired while driving or anything like that it was like something out of a hallmark movie because when i got to my brothers she literally burst out of the front door and jumped into my arms nearly knocking me over she acts like i just came home from war or something i said to my brother and all three of us laughed this was the moment i truly felt like a dad because i was just so in the moment for once in my life and didnt think about anything else except her and me its that thing where we just look at each other and smile not saying anything and we just know how much we care about each other we touched our heads and even i felt myself cry a little bit that day in particular was the day for me and it mad me realize that for me the hardest thing about being a parent so far isnt having to deal with her bad days or stuff at school or any of that its knowing i cant always be around 247 yes she has my brother and other family to count on for support and is close with all of them but the idea of her being gone one day and off to college or wherever she goes frightens me a bit i know it shouldnt but it does nevertheless i try to focus on the here and now as much as i can and do anything and everything for her if i really had to do it all over again i wouldve gotten her out of that place and away from her mom much sooner,0
i dont like being a man i dont like being me i really dont know where to post this but i just need to vent about it so i went here i hate everything about my body i hate all of my body hair i hate the shape i hate any shred of masculinity im not supposed to though im a man and should be proud of my masculinity and i should act masculine i hate these expectations im only ever really happy with my appearanceor sometimes in generalwhen im wearing makeup or am feeling feminine its been bugging me so much as of late its been like this my whole life to varying degrees but its been getting worse and worse recently i dont really know what it is or why but im kinda tired of it already usually im able to pretend like the person in the mirror is someone else but lately i just cant im just glad i dont hate women out of jealousy anymore lmao i was in deep denial about whatever the fuck this is if i kinda got through it before i can do it again i really wish i was born a woman though id be a lot more happier in general i think this thing isnt pairing well with my depression and anxiety either nor my already pitiful self esteem i dont really see a point in life anymore and its all just kinda meaningless to me yet i care so much about what people think i just wanna be happy and stay happy for once even just for a whole day not just for a minute of blissful ignorance sorry for venting none of this is organized so sorry about that too,1

just really fucking tired of being so tired nothing makes me feel anymore i just want to stop being like this im wasting everyones time i dont wabt to bother getting better when i can just aswell die and disapear i dont have enough energy to do anything im just rotting and waiting for death counting days,1
i dont want to die i just dont want to exist im just really tired i dont want to do this anymore i cant talk about not wanting to exist because people just think im suicidal i think about it a lot but id never actually do it i know the effect it would have on my family and i wouldnt wish that on them i wish i could be selfish in that way and do something for myself but i cant let my family feel guilty for something that wasnt their doing i guess im just going to have to settle for the constant urge to fast forward through all this bullshit until i can finally die,1
i wanted to kill myself at 8 years old so i swallowed a bunch of flintstone vitamins i laugh at it now after all these years i had seen it on tv that someone committed suicide by od all it did i think was give me an upset stomach im 27 now honestly surprised im still here ive been feeling very suicidal the past couple of days the only thing that stops me is my baby brother i take care of everyday when he goes home though i dont know i just hope my mood is better by then i know part of me doesnt want to die but the feeling is so forceful and impulsive,1
i feel so guilty for having depression when ive not really had anything traumatic happen to me and theres so much evil going on in the world i dont deserve this life,1
stress at night sometimes when im going to sleep ill just keep going over a mistake i made that day or stress over the next day and i just keep thinking about either one over and over again and i cant stop it to the point where ill try to sleep at 10 and fall asleep at 11 or 12 or in more extreme cases where i cant sleep and get stressed out because of that i wont sleep until 2 am thats only happened a handful of times and everytime it does i look up sleep techniques which dont work or try to use as mr which usually works but doesnt in that situation,1
i have constant passive suicidal thoughts recently i think ive been okay not super happy but not completely down in the dumps but ever since about a week ago ive been getting passive suicidal thoughts if you dont know what that is its when you think about suicide but have no actual plan or motive to do it this has happened every day even this morning my first thought when getting out of bed was i should just die these thoughts get annoying as it demotivates me from what i have to do during the day which makes me feel useless which makes me think about suicide its an endless fucking cycle and i hate it,1
im a masochist i am at the edge i wont commit suicide but the depression has pretty much taken over my life my depression is not me it is a disease this disease has manifested itself into me discarding selfcare i dont want to buy new clothes for myself engage in any enjoyable hobbies or do anything that i would enjoy i keep putting those things off every day for the past two years i have been putting off selfcare because im not there yet its this perpetual feeling of inadequacy of constantly trying to catch up i think school partially did this to me i was conditioned into prioritizing work first and foremost it instilled into me a kind of selflessness leisure was relegated to 20 or so minutes of recesslunch it wasnt important this isnt an angsty school sucks sentiment i mean it does but my viewpoint doesnt come from a place of complete directionless anger i dont want to blame anything for my problems but the cold truth is that school rewards masochism which i in part adopted i tried to escape the stress by procrastinating which would lead me to missing deadlines which resulted in selfhatred i had to escape the stress along with myself its funny because i wasnt even that good of a student what was the point in studying when im was and am so unhappy i am a masochist i put off happiness because i feel as if i do not deserve it it makes me feel inhuman who would do such a thing i havent felt happiness in literal years even during moments of leisure i never felt content i always had to be doing something because productivity is an instilled and admirable trait i feel warped i dont feel human i let everything pass me by im so fucked up i wont commit suicide i cant but right now the thoughts are taking full force im so disgusted with myself that i dont even behave like a normal person that im so compulsive and masochistic and crazy i have nothing i am lonely i am selfless i just want it all to end i want to wake up as a normal person i feel dysphoria with myself as a person not gender dysphoria but the term in a general sense an unease and deep dissatisfaction with myself even when i should be feeling happy im not everything just feels so fake and shallow how can someone like me ever heal if their brain has been wired like this for so long this chemical imbalance is only getting worse,1
family know i have depression but they say everyone has it well fuck no not everyone suffer as us not everyone try to pass the day like this or fucking fight suicide thought on the daily they even dont believe that i fucking have pain,1
i have been making notes to people as a final goodbye i dont know if i should be doing this or not but for the one person i loved i have been writing a letter like a apology and if im going to be dead i can send it to them i havent done it for anyone else because i dont have anyone else i want to say sorry to and let them know my final thoughts about them i have ended u making her dislike me a little and i feel like making her dislike me so if im gone she wouldnt feel sad about me for the final gifts i plan on gibbing i got her this special necklace and i just hope she wears it one time the next time i see her so i can see her beautiful smile while wearing the necklace i got her for the first time then i feel like i can go without worry this is the note for anyone curious in reading it but every day i write more and more into this because im trying to make the best goodbye letter can i confess something right now im really scared and sad and hating everything i really feel worthless and i hate the fact that i have the shit in my head it makes me feel like a burden to other people recently tho i dont know why but you keep popping up in this dream and its the same one over and over its of you and me and we are cuddling im all happy then its just you by yourself while i slowly sink into a pitch blackness as i struggle to get to you but you dont notice me drowning slowly in the darkness and you move on and live your life while im stuck in that darkness slowly drowning and then i woke up in a panic attack i dont mean to put stress on you i may never send this but even if im gone and stuck in the darkness it made me feel as though im already gone to you and im just a thing of the past maybe i already am i dont understand why i am like this i hate it but every time i get that dream i can only think that it means that im going to be gone for good and that im no longer important to the only person i have ever loved if this is sent its after i give you the presents and after that i plan to be gone completely you wont ever have to hear from me again and you can live the happy life i know you will have this is hard to write because i dont know how you will feel towards me being gone for good ive been trying my best to be helpful to you and trying to make you smile and feel better when im gone though i hope that you are able to be happy and that you take care of the things that are special to me that i gave you this is already long enough i dont even know if you will read all of this through but if you did i loved you and you brought me almost all of my happy memories i dont know if you think i was a bad boyfriend or not and that most of our relationship was bad because it wasnt it was the funniest and the best thing in my life and i hope that you can remember me with the good memories of us when im gone especially the ice skating one that is the most special memory i have of us besides when we first became a couple and our first kiss well if im still here after i sent this text then im sorry i always wished i could have married you and started a family with you but lifes not fair so thank you for the good memories and showing me the happiness that i thought i would never had i know you regret a lot of things with me and i hope by the time i send this that we would have made amends and you forgave me if not then at least me being gone will be easier for you to move on and not feel bad or guilty when you think about me i hope you care for the gifts because they will be the last things you get from me i dont know if i will send this maybe before a hangout with everyone or maybe after so i could hangout with you one last time and see your smiling face,1

the most depressing part about turning 30 is when you start thinking this really is my life after all when youre 18 you can make mistakes you have the time to fix them they dont define the rest of your life you have a decade to build a life for yourself there is always that hope that one day things might turn out well for you there is excitement life is full of colour but off in the distance you see a storm and road in greyscale then you turn 30 and suddenly the road ahead that looked dark and stormy ahead of you is the road youre now walking down and all you can see is darkness for the next 50 years of your life nobody is coming to save you or bail you out i would give anything to go back and do things over but there is no reset button you cant start a new save file all you can do is turn off the game for people in their late teensearly twenties dont waste a moment appreciate the time you are living in and the fact that you have several important years to work with they disappear without warning and one day it will hit you like a fucking dump truck in the chest that you have lost them forever,1

the cancer has spread to my liver well its most likely the cancer anyways the doctors like to make me feel better by saying theres a chance itll be benign but so far it never has been every test has come back as bad news which just leads to more tests and more uncertainty the pain in my hips has come back and knowing i have a fresh mass in my liver thats already 5cm acrossit freaks me out it wasnt there when i had surgery in the beginning of may which means its spreading and fast i was feeling ok for a couple weeks but the pain is coming back and im scared for the abdominal pain to come backthat was the worst the hurt in my hip is like a constant dull ache thats always bothering me but the pain in my abdomen was like always feeling like puking but never actually puking along with stabbing pain if i moved wrong i dont want that again i even talked to my doctor about going back to work and she said go for it if i feel okay but what if i dont actually feel okay what if it just keeps getting worse will i ever be back to normal will i be able to go back to school in the fall will i be able to finish my degree or will the cancer completely derail the one goal i had finally started to crawl towards i have a biopsy scheduled in 2 weeks and im scared for that my first biopsy didnt give conclusive results that lead to 4 months of waiting for surgery bc no one thought it was serious im terrified of that happening again im just so full of uncertainty and im scared and i feel like im not valid for feeling any of it people have it worse than i do so my brain tells me i dont get to be upset but i am but i dont want to be im conflicted im upset i want to sleep so i dont have to feel forgive the rant but thank you if you read through my woes anyways edit i posted this without much thought last night in the middle of a break down and went right to sleep afterwards i cant believe the amount of support people have shown meim in shock you all are so nice and lovelyit definitely helps the ol psyche when so many people affirm that im allowed to be upset so thank you to everyone who has commented or upvoted these little moments of support help so much sometimes thank you,1

im burning out im a uni student in 2nd year and im starting to burn out idk what to do,1
too depressed to be productive and not depressed enough to kill myself i lowkey wish i can be pushed over the edge so ill have the courage to end it all as horrible as that sounds,1
does anyone else want to kill themself but they dont want to do that to their family so they go by day by day with the only true motivation in their life being the day they finally grow distant enough from their family that they can end it all without the guilt the worst part is now i have a girlfriend that ive dating for a while and im crazy about her and weve talked about our future together numerous times and shes the single that can prevent me from reaching that true point of fully distanced from those i care about and it somehow makes me sad instead of happy,1
severe anxiety derealization agoraphobia depression hello good people i hope u are having a great day and u will have the patience to read my post im not native english speaker so i apologize in advance if i make some errors i am writing this post which is more like a cry for help during a time when i feel like i touched the bottom of life i have struggled with anxiety pretty much my whole life without knowing it in my childhood everyone around me as well as myself thought that i was just a shy and insecure kid everything started very early in my childhood i was around 67 years old when i had to go to school but could not do it and in many different occasions i felt very anxious and started having derealization which i had no idea what it was back then i would have go home when i felt it and it was going away always when i had to do something new or something where i felt uncomfortable i got anxiety and sometimes derealization almost never i could go on a vacation or on an excursion and relax and enjoy it fully like everyone else the feeling was so strong that i almost always had physical symptoms i would feel sick or had to go to the bathroom and my whole body was stiff could never fully relax my whole life i was involved with sports and this mental issues prevented me from giving my 100 in sports things got better when i was around 12 years old i had many friends i felt very comfortable in school had a lot of fun and almost the whole day i was outside with my friends playing and having fun so all this mental issues were reduced significantly life seemed normal again but then when i had to start in high school everything changed i lost almost all of my friends they went in different schools and everyone found new friends and i could not go to school anymore i could not adapt and the anxiety went through the roof so i started isolating myself at home btw i live in a third world country so not going to high school is punishable u have to pay a very big fine so the people at the school and some relatives tried to scare me saying that my family was going to pay a big fine etc but this made me even more angry after this life never really returned to normal i spent most of the days at home or in the house of my grandparents had no close friends and never have been in a relationship in my life but i was feeling very comfortable at home at the beginning but very soon it took its toll i developed ocd again without knowing what it was im sure many of u are familiar with this term and know what it is i struggled with it for many years afterwards plus the severe anxiety i managed to solve it ocd pretty much completely on my own and then the life gave me the biggest punch first my grandpa with whom i was very close got sick and died which had an incredibly big impact on me and 2 months later my father had a stroke which fortunately he survived and recovered from completely but the trauma that i went through was very big in those times i had almost no emotional support i was pretty much left on my own to go through that period i did not want to bother my mother to console me because i did not want to show any weakness in those times when she was too devastated by that event so i went through all that period with my head held up high and then when it all settled the sit hit the fan severe anxiety ocd and derealization came back the derealization became so strong and it still is that i cannot fight it every time when i leave my roomafter that i started having panic attacks which led very fast to agoraphobia now for the last 5 months im almost everyday 24h in my room with very little human contact i take a shower rarely and sometimes it feels very difficult even to change my clothes so far in my life i have been on 3 different medications and ive seen many psychologistspsychiatrists including hypnotic therapy but the anxiety seems to have won against everything i was very religious pretty much my whole life going to church praying but now i know that i completely lost my faith the most beautiful thing that happened to me in the last few years is the girl that i met few weeks ago online she lives in a neighbouring country and i immediately felt connection and now can say for sure that i felt in love after many many years and it seems that the love is returned but on the other hand what makes me sad and i write this with tears rolling down my face is the fact that with all this mental issues i cannot make her happy i cannot have a normal life even though she says that she loves my company suicidal and selfharming thoughts have been regular in the past few months along with the depression i lost interest in many things that i loved i think i said enough i opened my heart and i dont even know why i did it but maybe somebody can relate and give some help or maybe this post of mine is going to be helpful for other people thank you very much for taking the time to read this and i really hope that all of you struggling with mental issues will find a solution and get your life back,1

how do you get over overthinking ever since i was a little kid ive always overthought if i make a mistake ill think about it for days which turn into weeks and sometimes months for example about a week and a half ago i picked up my friend and her cousin and went to the mall and i accidentally took the exit incorrectly there was traffic cones and shit and i still think about because im so embarrassed the moment keeps replaying in my head and i keep coming up with solutions to the situation like what if i killed us 3 what if i hurt other people exiting what if everyones scared of driving with me again what if i hit someone or someone hit me what if there wasnt any road right there what couldve happened because of my stupidity like im just so fucking annoying and stupid and dumb i hate me bro ill think about things that happened years ago and itll be on my mind for the longest time until i just simply forget sometimes when i get the thinking and get annoyed in a way and i slap my head as if i can slap the thought out of me it stresses me out so bad sometimes i just wish i could just die so i wont have to think at all my thoughts eat away at me my friend kept yelling at me last night and the more she did the more sadder i got and kept overthinking that i was an annoying pest and they didnt want me around i kept calling people to say happy halloween and both my friends kept yelling and i know they meant it innocently but now i just cantwont stop thinking about it i just know it i just dont know how to stop thinking and i need help how do i stop overthinking what can i do,0
lymph nodes can stress and or anxiety cause lymph nodes to swell i have one in my neck that had been there for like 4 months now and it hasnt grown or anything just feels like a pea i can feel it but you cant see it it just feels like a pea or smaller i went to the doctor all they said was to watch it,1

i dont really know what to title this im really new to reddit so please let me know if im somehow doing this wrong so obviously based on the topic i suffer from depression and anxiety and have done since i was a kid i lived with my mum until i was 13 and suffered neglect and slight emotional abuse while living with her which obviously was the trigger for the anxiety and the depression im mostly good now im on medication and ive been seeing a counsellor at uni for most of my degree but sometimes i think about my childhood and get a bit of an oof feeling over smaller things which is whats brought me here because of neglect from my mother i have bad oral hygiene growing up she never really encouraged me to be clean and stuff so i was never told that i had to brush my teeth in the morning and evening because of this brushing my teeth isnt something i remember to do and the importance of good dental hygiene was never something i was taught and as simple a thing as it sounds its one of the main things that stuck with me as a kind of memory from growing up in a neglectful environment i really struggle with remembering to brush my teeth and i dont feel like asking my friends or flatmates to remind me to brush my teeth is really an option im not sure if this made much sense or if its allowed here but i just wanted to get it off my chest,1

slowly i didnt realize i was already killing myself first i killed the athlete there wasnt much of him to begin with so it was easy at the least he tried to give an effort to materialize during my college days he even joined some after school group of friends to play with that didnt really go anywhere next i killed the gamer he was easy to kill too because of the need the corporate life taking much of my time didnt leave enough breathing room for him to keep up a fight his antics still surface every now and then making me wish for adventures and the blood pumping suspense or action of his previous endeavors i just stuffed his mouth with career dreams he didnt really struggle as he believed that to asphyxiate was actually reasonable next i killed the party boy this one took a little bit more orchestration than the previous two i had to kill his connections with his friends i had to starve him of his former social saturation and in a way that he wont easily recourse back i made his friends believe he didnt need the contact that he was happy the party boy slowly lost his spirit thats when i went for the jugular to end his pain next i killed the musician i almost didnt like killing him hes the most recent one and the most difficult one to get rid of he has support your see all the feelings and emotions closing through him everytime he hears plays or sings a song gives him enough strength to push back hes even made a solid group of friends that push and pull him to their graces but an opening came in the guise of leaving the country that tiny waver in his resolve let me sneak in a stab it was easy enough from then on im just afraid that eventually i might kill the writer too and when i do i dont really know whats left im actually surprised to realize that ive been hurting myself without physically doing so ive lost more of myself in the past few months than i ever had in years and im not making any more of me than what i already have ps i wrote this to myself at a bad time about a year ago and putting what ive been doing in words has surprisingly help me curb and slowly regain myself throughout the past year i still get spans of time where i feel like nothing where i feel afraid of being nothing that id rather just lose my life but remember all youve been through things may not feel the best now but you are not worthless you matter theres a value to everything youve done and accomplished so lets all hold on and hold tight edit thank you so much for giving my first gold kind stranger and to everybody whos commenting i wish i had more time to reply to all of you im surprised with the turnout and even more with how people feel the same and areis going through losing parts of themselves lets all keep holding on to those and try our best not to lose more than we do and for those who feel empty its never too late to find yourself lets all fight for it even if it starts with just getting up from your bed in the morning,1

went for 2 am walk in the rain finally felt alive and free after 34 of a bottle of pinot grigio i decided to take my one woman pity party outside i let the rain fall on my face i let it soak my sweater i walked down the middle of the street while the pavement shimmered in front of me i stood by the water while black waves rolled towards my feet and the wind blew rain into my face i held my arms out and let the wind blow across my body i waked through the park i got on a swing in the playground and let my legs take me as high as i could like when i was a kid i spun in the middle of the street while water got in my boots and soaked my socks i fucking skipped down the middle of the street in the rain without a soul around and i know i will eventually fall asleep and tomorrow will crush me like every other day but i really felt alive tonight for a little while you guys sorry for the theatrics the pinot is still working its magic happy tuesday edit just wanted to say how moved i am by other people sharing their similar experience or saying that this post made them feel happy or comforted as hard as it is to believe sometimes we all deserve to feel that way today was as hard as any other day but i know somewhere i have the capacity to feel better we all do,1

im probably the unhappiest person alive yet i dont go out of my way to hurt anyone if anything im just self destructive but it seems like no matter what i do i just wont fucking die lol,1
loving someone with depression anxiety im a person that suffers from both of these from a very young age i know how difficult it can be and i know its even more difficult to love someone in this condition because you need to be patient especially if the person youre dating had an abusive past you need to try your best to stay calm and listen to what they have to say it takes lot of time and effort for someone in this condition to learn to be themselves around you without having to hide the breakdowns and all the other stuff it takes time and it takes trust so if you cant love someone like this my advice is to leave because theyve already been through enough i didnt mean to offend anyone its just my point of view about this situation,1
im almost 28 and i have wasted my life in a few months i will 28 and i have wasted my life i have never had a job a girlfriend or a close friend i graduated high school in 2012 and since then i have isolated myself rarely leaving my house im posting this hoping someone will listen and maybe give advice i was raised by my grandparents and growing up they were controlling and overprotective i did not get to do things most other kids were doing i just stayed home all the time and played video games or watched tv when i was in school i had no friends and rarely talked i was not bullied but most of my classmates would not talk to me my teachers said i had a learning disability so thought out school i had extra help with my classes my grandfather died in 2007 after high school i isolated myself i have had opportunities to get jobs but i was scared to talk to strangers the time has passed by so fast and i cant believe i let this happened i feel like there is no hope for things to change who would hire someone like me i made bad grades in school and too poor to go to a community college i also would like a girlfriend but im short and too shy im very depressed and thinking about ending my life edit i never thought my post would get this much attention i watched a youtube about suicidal thoughts and the guy said reddit helped him so i thought i would give this a tryi thank you all for the comments,1
am i 28f actually depressed i often have to think about how meaningless existence is about how were all going to die and there is no escape from it how the universe and everything we know is going to end and all that is is actually ephemeral and vain these thoughts haunt me to the point of getting really anxious i try to tell myself that it doesnt matter and what matters is enjoying the limited time we all have here on earth but then i look around think about global warming endless wars and struggle to find meaning in a meaningless world and i just cant be happy my whole life i have been looking for something more than just average normal life but then i think we all are looking for the more but the more never comes people who aint depressed are just people who realize it first and adapt to the nothingness of everyday i dont want to adapt i dont want to burn out i keep on telling myself that what really matters in my life and what makes me different from others is that i have a passion i have visions i have true feelings i have a flame that keeps me alive but also that makes me desperate for something greater than life itself but there is nothing greater and everything leaves me feeling dissatisfied i still fight cause otherwise it just wouldnt make sense for me i work a lot cause i want to be one of the best in my field i create a lot because i want to be successful as an artist i exercise a lot cause i want to be the one with the best body i read a lot of books cause i want to be the smartest person in every room i debate people cause i want to show everyone that i have ides and opinions i spend hours preparing before going somewhere cause i want to be the best looking one everywhere i go being avereage is simply a waste of existence for me whenever i work on myself get productive creative set goals my depression gets a tiny bit better after all it always comes back but that makes me even more drown to be productive and competetive in the end of the day when everything is quiet and i am at home with partner and he tells me that he loves me i realize that i do not feel anything much and the thirst for the more becomes almost unbearable i cant calm myself i often have to use alcohol to get rid of anxiety over dying and feeling endlesly bored and empty then i need to escape the real world and get lost in my imagination about life that i could have had in a different reality i can stare at the wall for hours imaging a different kind of life for myself the thing is no matter how hard i try to get it i never feel good about myself or anything really i am at that point where i think having children is an act of horror existence is a painfuldissatisfyingtorture and i would never put another being through the hell of human life at the same time i know that all i have to do is keep trying and working and even harder and harder and harder to become the perfect version of the perfect me,1
dont know how to live its difficult to go on i wish for this to be over soon i wish to die everyday every minute if i were to die this moment i would be the happiest person at the moment because itll be over but it would be terribly selfish of me to die before my mother she wont be able to bear it she would she has three more children but ill cause sorrow and so it must be me who suffers its hard i feel sorrow for no reason then there are reasons which i try to avoid i dont know what to do how to keep on breathing,1
i was looking at this place for the last 20 min and i might as well share whats bothering me i do not think i am depressed i do not self diagnose with depression at points i think i am pathetic and making myself feel bad just because i am bored one moment i can be with a pillow over my face trying to science my crying the next i am thinking everything is okay and i am just being dramatic for context i am a guy in highschool i am bulgarian and my parents have been divorced for roughly half my life and a bit longer at this point thats all the info i am giving out for now this summer has probably been the worst one for me back in 2019 i was spending my 1st month of summer break watching anime and playing games after that my ex who i have known for 8 years more so knew as we are on bad terms now introduced me to a friend of hers and we started going out nearly daily out friend group slowly grew as we moved to highschool we are about 15 people at one point and that was probably the best time of my life in the coming months our friend group became smaller and smaller and by summer 2020 it was only 8 of us by october it was only 4 of us and by the end of october i was alone i went form having a ton of friends to basically having no one i got closer with one of the 4 people and we are now pretty good friends and helped me get a new friend group but even with a new friend group this summer i havent gone out with anyone since june the 30th i havent hung out with anyone barely anyone has texted me and i feel alone as shit i have just been gaming and watching anime thankfully i met my girlfriend back in may but she lives all the way in the usa so my hopes of ever meeting her are pretty low but she helps me to keep on moving on at points i really do hope that life will get better as i grow older but i feel like i will never be happy again as the current person i am i feel like i fucked up in this life and i envy anyone who has a nice friendgroup there was this one tiktok of 3 girls cosplay characters form chainsaw man and just hanging out its unreal how jealous i felt of people who were having fun together i wish that when i am older i will be able to hang out with people i like and go places i wanted to go to with my gf but at the same time i have been crying nearly every night the last week thinking about how i am stuck in this country without anyone i am very sorry that this post is such a mess i just really needed to vent as i dont want to bother people who i game with and people that usually see the so called happy and positive side of me is there any advice that you would give me so that i could atleast be a little more hopeful of the future,1

how do i see a psychiatrist over the past 6 years i often experience some phases lasting a few weeks to a few months and during those periods i cant control my own emotions i get annoyed by every small thing and i keep crying throughout the day i also shut my friends out and dont feel like talking to anyone my appetite is also horrible and i dont eat a bowl of rice per day however it doesnt really affect my work and im kind of a workaholic so people around me think im normal hopefully i also always feel anxious and have had a few attacks recently i sought help from a local nonprofit organization and ive been going for free counselling for a year sometimes it helps but sometimes it doesnt so even though im slightly better at managing these phases it still happens and affects my daily life my friends are forcing me to see a psych because they think i should get a diagnosis and meds and a part of me wants to because i want to get better but a part of me doesnt want to because i feel like its a waste of money and its going to be very difficult to convince my parents im 17 yo singaporean i cant go by myself because im broke but my parents wouldnt bring me because they arent even willing to bring me to a doctor for my physical issues im experiencing nerve pain in my leg and if it continues i think i might become cripple any issuesickness i have they tell me to drink water and take a walk in the park as if that will make me magically feel better my parents fight multiple times everyday since i was young and there was a point of time they wanted to divorce and i think it has affected me so i always try to handle my own things myself im also used to feeling depressed and anxious because ive been dealing with it just fine maybe not for the past 6 years im thinking of telling my parents one more time but if it doesnt work ill have to starve save up and go by myself at a later time i honestly dont know what to do at this point im so lost i feel like a crazy person sorry that this post is all over the place,1

what depression actually looks like playing a wow vanilla server trying to remember fun from a decade passed staying up till 5am even though you know you have to work at noon scrolling through your facebook timeline and wondering who these people are earing garbage from vending machines instead of proper food saying youll quit smoking as you buy another pack wondering why you still have these problems at 30 crushing loneliness despite not actively seeking a relationship never calling what little friends you have and wondering why they dont call you,1
i wish i could donate my life to someone who actually deserves it a while ago i got into an argument with a guy because he implied that i was immature for complaining about being in college he said dont forget youre taking up space in a class someone else would love to be taking even before i heard that i felt like i was a waste of space and resources but that of all things just made it so much worse somehow ive wasted pretty much every gift ive been given and all i want is to die in peace but i cant even do that edit thanks for all the replies everyone i wasnt expecting this to gain so much traction and its nice to know how many people care thanks for the award as well,1

people making me feel good about myself all of a sudden i never had many friends im an introvert and have the kind of face that apparently makes me look unapproachable and arrogant im neither im just shy as hell i dont have many friends i have very few but close friends the kind i can trust with my life and vice versa but all of them live hours away so in the city i live in i have only colleagues or acquaintances yet in the last 7 days 3 people i would have considered long time acquaintances at best have contacted me and asked me to hang out they dont know each other so it must be one weird coincidence i went out with all of them had drinks which i know can make me weird and every single one of them said theyd like to spend more time with me hang out more often play video games go to the theatre etc i never had anyone show any genuine interest in me ever before unless i had reason to assume they tried to manipulate me eg i look epic in my new dress the sudden male interest clearly has nothing to do with my shining personality and am a bit overwhelmed even tonight i went out and started chatting to random people and met a brazilian author im a librarian so books are my thing who not only signed me his most recent work to my new stunningly beautiful friend who i hope will one day go out with me but kept complimenting me and even if i hadnt spoken a word to him just from his looks the way he holds himself etc hed clearly be miles out of my league im not ugly but at first glance im not special either something has changed for me i know i havent yet dynamics are so much more in my favour than i ever thought possible i love it im happy i feel that people finally see the person i am it bothers me because its too good to be true but right now im just happy elated content life is good at last,0
has anyone get the urge to gagthrow up when overwhelmed with stress lately this has been happening a lot it is most likely college and im also having trouble getting sleep because of my messed up sleep schedule of going to sleep at 7am and waking up at 5pm at the moment im trying to reset my sleep of staying up all day till the late afternoon to sleep i dont know if this is the right way to go to help myself to sleep i for sure know that today is going to be really stressful and the gaging will be consistent when i dare to yawn or even open my mouth when i talk i know the usual tips of helping myself is in rsleep but im hoping im not the only one with this symptom that it isnt a bad sign,1

i got accused of plagiarism at university for a maths assignment last week i received an email about plagiarism on my last maths assignment it was an online subject that required students to check in online and view the tutors online whiteboard each student is signed in with their student number that at first caused me to have an anxiety attack at work but later on got over it because i came to my senses that this was causing me unnecessary stress when i did not plagiarise the email required me to have an interview with three people tutor unit coordinator and an observer but i am not obliged to go but i did anyways the email notified me to bring the person i plagiarised off from but the thing is i actually dont know anyone let a lone plagiarised off someone i did call them up and said i did have a friend to guide me with my maths assignment who does not do the subject at all basically does a different course completely same uni but different campus so fast forward to the date of the interview i was pretty confident of clearing my innocent i brought my friend in and they asked the guy next to be was the other plagiariser while exposing their name i blurted out whos that by accident so during the interview they brought out my assignment and the other persons only one question consisting abc were exactly the same how uncanny the thing is that was only like 10 of the assignment i do understand their point of view out of a few hundred students me and this person had the exact same answers so some of the answers were wrong but the plagiarised section they were asking me how i got the working out for these questions my dumbass really did guess it but i was able to explain how i got it the coordinators face was literally like this dumb bitch got an easy question wrong and plagiarised it but my explanation that literally disregarded it and just said how did you manage to plagiarise i did say i got them off the lecture notes but i really have no idea how i have the same answers as the other person anyways during the interview they were trying to throw my friend and i under the bus to admit to at least cheating which we did not all assessment at uni requires a signature to agreeing that all works is done by yourself only they were trying to imply i was cheating because my friend with me looked over my assessment questions they were trying to get him to agree basically that he did my assignment questions thank god he kept saying i only guided her with example questions just like the assignment you have given him which he actually did only guided me because i am trash at maths they said if you did get a tutor for this assignment that is cheating and that is a misconduct as it is not your own work but seriously what the hell i actually dont know anyone in this subject because it is all online lol i barely attended the online lectures it is summer break after all after the interview theyre just telling me to think about who i plagiarised off from so this is just implying im already screwed because i have to see the dean if he will dismiss this matter there are two guidelines i have to follow which is regardless brutal if i did plagiarise record fines etc and if i did not if i did not im still not off the hook basically this is stressing me out badly for no reason i cant prove my innocence when i walked outside the room i think the person who i apparently plagiarised was there i have never seen them before in my life im just causing shitty outcome scenarios in my head like what if the person said i did but i didnt they school just wants to hear the answer they wanna hear i cant prove my innocence how can they prove my plagiarism the unit coordinator is the one who reported this but said he cant clear it the dean has to i just have to wait for a dreading email what to do and more interviews i have two final exams left for summer and i just cant clear my head for this unnecessary problem one of the the exams is this subject i need to study,1

managing stress when checking blood pressure hi i suffer from hypertension im currently taking medication for it and i check my blood pressure everyday i have good days and bad days however theyre mostly bad when im stressing i usually always start to stress when i need to check my blood pressure which causes it to spike so i usually check it quite a few times when i start to calm down sometimes breathing techniques have helped to lower it but other times i still have trouble is there anything else i can do to avoid these stress spikes,1
living is exhausting i am so used at distracting myself with things around me because if i never did i would probably get sad a lot and so life gets tiring my daytoday scene is just me working trying to drown myself with work so i wont be reminded of how sad i am living my life is but the thing is my body is so used to being sad that when good things finally start to happen in some ways life has its way of attacking me with shit and thats when being happy is scary because you know that bad things come after and that was tiring a lot,1
gifting my ex after all the shit we went through hey reddit i have a stupid idea but i might go for it im gonna offer my ex money i can afford it and maybe it could help him in his situation because of his situation he is considering suicide at least if you can trust his latest post on this page we just broke up and it was a bad breakup i decided i would cut him off completely and not reply no matter what he did some efforts to reach me and i ignored him for 3 days last night he messaged me saying that i could talk to him if i needed to and i replied today because of my intentions i decided to drop my ego but im stressed out waiting for a reply because my gut feeling says that he wont reply as a payback now i dont even know if his suicide plan is real but it worries me a lot it could be a dirty trick to get my attention or he just meant to say goodbye for the last time i dont know for real that also stresses me out thinking about him makes me feel extremly bad contacting him feels completely wrong but the reason i even wanna give him these money is because i care about him i did promise to help him out and also that i want to be a good person that keeps her promises,1

im so stressed out that im tired even after sleeping until 7pm i liked going to this forum for depressed people the only problem was one of the mods there who happens to be the husband of the owner of the forum has always been really rude to me and every time i reported his mean comments he would get super ticked off at me i posted a letters to admin thread saying i still feel bad that back in august that guy pmd me telling me to stop complaining about him and asking me why cant you just be normal and that guy or his wife who is nice but biased towards her husband it seems ip banned me i was chatting with members there one of them was a nice member that helped explain a very bad situation im in quite clearly but when i was ip banned and used a form to ask if i was really banned i got a message back and it said some rude things such as everyone is tired of you messaging them now i feel really bad i didnt know i was bothering people that much there to make matters all the worst i was freaking locked out of my twitter account i followed like just 3 accounts in a row seriously and was locked out for unusual activity usually when this happens i get texted a verification code and enter that and it lets me back in however this time it said i will get a phone call with a verification code i tried 3 times but i dont get a phone call i emailed twitter explaining that and requesting to get a text verification code again instead of a phone call but i just got this terrible automated response now that i cant get into my twitter account and it doesnt allow me to make a new account because too many accounts are linked to my phone number i dont know how to do the only thing i really feel like doing sharing my gaming videos and drawings etc it really really stresses me out now im just really tired,1

i cant seem to find anything worth the effort hello i just need a place to vent i dont know if it makes sense or not i feel that i have been living under this fog for the last 2 or 3 years everything lost its meaning nothing seems meaningful anymore i just cannot find the energy to even try to try new stuff i am constantly bored but at the same time not doing anything to have fun nothing is fun anymore i stopped trying now i just exist thats it i only exist but not in any meaningful way the worst part is the following i was supposed to be succesful my family had huge hopes for me and they tried to give me everything i need i have everything i need i dont have any reason to be like this unhappy and bored all the time but i am this caused me to slowly hate myself and now i literally hate myself i just hate the person that i see every night in the mirror i just hate him with all my gut i pushed people out of my life i think i did it deliberately because i did not want anyone to see me like this i did not let them know that i became a failure not even trying to do anything about it eventually everybody moved on i am not blaming them its not like they are supposed to waste their time trying to help a hopeless case like me it makes sense that they moved on now everybody is trying to improve themselves and i just have this hate towards everyone nobody did anything wrong and i just hate them for having the courage to try being happy i just hate them for not hating themselves three seconds after they wake up i just hate them for getting out of bed and start their day trying to get better and improve themselves this caused me to push everyone even further i cannot contact people because i dont want to answer the question so what are you doing these days because i dont have an answer to give i am not doing anything i never thought that i was going to become this disgusting human being that literally does not do anything does not try to get anything done and hates other people for doing stuff i just hate myself and i dont think that there is any hope left i am just stuck inside my brain i just dont think that there is anything left for me on this planet i am done i will just keep existing until someone takes this shit life away from me i just wished there was a way to give my life to someone who has a terminal illness but who wants to live i just wish that this torment ended,1

living a normal healthy positive life sounds exhausting all the stuff im doing right now is in theory to eventually get to this idealized normal healthy life im trying to start therapy again even though i think its pointless and part of me thinks the current standard for mental health treatment might be actively harmful to people im trying to save money cause youre supposed to im trying to lose weight so i can go places and develop some kind of active social life again im trying to improve at work and spend my time for productively but when i really think about what the end goal of all these things is i cant motivate myself to do any of them anymore because the end goal isnt that inherently appealing theres not that much i want to do ive had a healthy social life before its cool i guess but it doesnt excite me to think about having one again theres nowhere i want to go i cant even be bothered to finish making this post because ive already forgotten all the points i wanted to make my brain is fried,1

anyone wish there is a redo i just want to turn the clock back 10 years and redo everything and right all the wrongs now i cant too late and too much edit 05242020 i did read all the comments thank you this thought of regrets have tortured me so much a simple choice a decade ago still haunts me today and looms over me in the past two weeks wrestling my inner demons i lost so much weight and have lost so much mental curiosity and interest i used to possess but recently after watching being erica as some of you recommended i realized that no matter where you run you just end up running into yourself i suppose regrets will come in different forms no matter what i do or try the outcome would be the same that id be short of what i desire to be to be honest i dont know what a solution could be here but i suppose seeking it is part of that endless struggle,1

i want to stop relying on medicine i worry what antidepressants will do to my body in the long run whenever i get blood work done the results always come back abnormal my liver enzymes are always elevated and my regular doctor thinks it is because of the meds i take i also have problems sleeping most of the time i rarely get restful sleep is it possible for me to find a psychiatrist that would make a plan to get me better and get off of the meds i am afraid to stop taking them immediately because i have read that it can mess your body up i feel like every psychiatrist i go to doesnt really do anything to help get me better i understand i will never be perfect but i feel there has to be a way for me to live my life without shoving pills down my throat the rest of my life,1

universities really dont care i am sure covid has been extra stressful for everyone countless people have lost their jobs their health has deteriorated and im sure students can relate that online classes have been extremely stressful i do also understand where the professors stand they had to shift their whole life to sitting in front of a computer to teach to a bunch of unenthusiastic students who wont even turn their cameras on but at the same time we too are overpaying for an educational experience that isnt an experience at all sitting at our computers all day rushing to finish deadlines and studying for tests and just staying focused is hard while managing work thats just the cherry on top i do have some professors who have been very understanding and have helped a lot curving grades providing extra credit then we have my stats professor he bases our grades so heavily on the tests 2 tests and 1 final i have no idea what grade i have but i know im failing along with the rest of my class ive never done this badly in school ever i have never failed a class to say the least not understanding to our circumstances as an international student having to be awake at 3am to focus of math is a feat ive emailed him expressing my concerns no reply and its not just me the entire class is failing i have enrolled in the same class with a different professor for next semester in case i do not make it which i wont unless he curves it a whole 10 the amount of stress that is just waiting to blow up is insane and i cannot do anything to help my thoughts keep circulating back and fixating on that one thing how do you guys manage stress and anxiety ive tried almost everything,1
my girlfriend ex now i guess died in a car crash last week and we had dated since 10th grade and am 22 years old now am i terrible person for not even believing its real am i worse to fear going to her celebration of life because of how my emotions may come out ive never lost anyone who ive loved this much and i almost feel like dying with her we always talked about how we were soul mates and would die together the emptiness i feel is voidful and im not sure how to exist right now edit first some of you shared your past loses with me and it helped to feel surrounded by people who are still living strong despite such awful circumstances which made me feel awesome for lack of a better vocabulary and i love every one of you second wow i did not expect this overwhelming amount of support here and i feel like the whole world or at least this small subreddit is able to understand empathize with me it makes the this void of darkness i was looking into last night suddenly have a blossoming of light at the bottom more importantly helped me to understand that she is not gone unless i believe she is and she can still live on with me through my passions and i can continue hers in one way or another she always supported my dreams of becoming goku lol cheesy i know but now i will aspire even higher to looking and acting like goku and i supported her dreams of traveling and we went so many places but never to rome because we could never afford it i will go there and see the wonders of rome for us thank you all for helping me realize that its okay to feel whatever that feeling may be as long as it is benevolent,1

anyone else have underlying sadness even when doing something fun like ill be out trying to enjoy myself and ill be having a laugh or having a bit of fun but i still feel sad underneath hard to explain but nothing feels fulfilling even hobbies i have just seem dull and im usually just trying to mask the pain so i dont have to feel i hate this,1
hurt im not a very vocal person i tend to express myself better through writing this makes it so hard for me to get a job in somewhere i always wanted to work as i end up settling for places that where the interviewer has made the decision based on my resume itself instead of my vocal skills today i had an interview for a position in a wellpaying government job that i have always wanted i can see myself working with them but just i had to go fuck up the interview cause i hate talking to people i feel like fucking ripping my hair out because i am not a naturally charming person that can waft my way through things im not conventionally attractive or charming or any of those things so it makes it all the more difficult to actually get the things that i want i feel like a damn failure at 25unemployed and struggling to find a fucking job when all my peers are excelling in their careers and i am just here being a slob,1
my surgery went so well i went from debilitating chronic pain to completely painfree in days i feel so lucky i just want to share because im so happy i feel like i have a new lease on life i wasnt able to walk and spent so much time in bed now im appreciating all the beauty life has to offer so much more ill never take for granted being painfree again i was honestly fighting for my life i was so depressed and frantic because of how much pain i was feeling and now i feel so good my body feels so beautiful and healthy im excited about my future again,0
be the bigger person just means let people hurt you without any consequences and it can be crushing to be shamed for retaliation,1
depression steals your youth away i remember when i was 15 and my depression started that was 1995 i hated school with a passion that was the first year i ever was on a antidepressant aka prozac which didnt help at all by the year 2000 i was finishing high school i was going on 6 years of depression at that point and i already had a overdose suicide attempt a year prior now im 40 years old and it has been 26 years of depression i never accomplished anything in my life never even had a gf a complete absolute loser and now on top of that i have permanent neurological health problems that makes my life even worst its not from my suicide attempt but something not related i guess my point is depression made me lazy and a miserable bastard that never connected with the outside world it stoled my youth away something i can never have back living with regrets is just as bad as depression dont be me there is no recovering from lost time and permanent health issues plus clinical depression its a living hell all i can say is if youre still young and at least have your physical health you need to go and try your hardest to at least try to find happiness while you can it may seem impossible but dont be a loser like me and quit right away keep on pushing while you can before its to late,1
worst part about depression is that i feel like i have no personality anymore there are other worse stuff but this is what comes to mind honestly feels like im bland af now and boring to other people one of the reasons why i dont even want to try anymore because i dont want to bore them,1
i feel like my life is a tv series that shouldve been cancelled 4 seasons ago nothing brings me joy anymore not even my greatest accomplishments make me feel anything kind of like a show thats run its course but the showrunners keep finding cool and wacky scenarios to put the main characters in but nothing hits like it used to i just want whatever the fuck this is to end,1
my appetite got strong even if im full after my insomnia was improved i dont know why but my overeating habit got severe after my insomnia was improved why,1
what ive been going through lately so currently im in high school and in my psychology class we were assigned a project about mental disorders to work on over spring break and today is the last day of spring break and the project is due tomorrow and i havent started the project due to no wifi at home i havent had wifi in 3 weeks life wiithout wifi sucks but you get used to it you find other things to do what i did was drew pictures and knitted yes knitted my grandma taught me awhile ago it is actually fun until you loose the loops meaning the yarn fell off your knitting needle and you have to guess where the loops were the thing im making is all screwed up due to that happeninh but yeah i can knit back to the no wifi thing somehow my tablet still shows i have wifiand my apps work and youtube on my tablet will not work without wifi i even have data but it still wont work so if its working i know im good so i hope this actually does get postedif not oh well as i stated earlier im in high school which means i live with my parents and our landlord wants us out so he can either rent to someone else or rent the house to his daughters and to be honest the house isnt in good condition when we moved in the walls werent repainted the plumbing wasnt fixed etc and the heater is broken when it rains the ceiling leaksand so oni actually posted what the landlord has been doing and stuff on this sub reddit awhile ago so you can check it out if you want anyways last week on thursday we recieved a notice to move out by sunday which is today we have gotten almost everything outbut still have the essentials left tv couch my parents bed and bed frame fridge mine and my brothers baby stuff that my mom doesnt want to lose and my dads tools we got approved for an apartment but cant move stuff in until tomorrow at 11 00 but we have to be out by midnight tonight so instead of a hotel we are staying here for the night hoping no ones comes by to escort us out we are staying because if we went to a hotel and came back for the rest of our stuff we would lose the stuff ontop of this my dad started drinking againand yesterday he went outback to have a smoke and he somehow caught his hair on firestill not sure how it happened but ill never forget his screamits going to haunt me forever but luckily he is okay and thank god he is he did however get slightly burned on his forehead but other than that hes alive breathing and not in the hospital before that happened i actually was thinking of cutting myself because of everything that has been going on but i was going to do deep cuts to where i would need to go to the hospital and i was going to do it but i never went through with it especially after hearing my dad scream i couldnt bring myself to do it due to all this moving my dog has been acting weird shes been shaking whining trying to wedge herself under chairs trying to hide under the table etc everytime i look at her she has this sad look in her eyes and i feel bad for her i think why she is like this is because she thinks we are going to take her back to the pound or abandon her but we are not the kind of people to do that shes been a part of this family for about 7 years i thinkim not sure so yeah thats my life at the moment,1
i am very afraid ive been unhappy for most of my life with the exception of maybe the first few years ive been bullied most of my life mainly during school and not having many friends and my mental state wasnt in much of a good place either i mainly often hid it but sometimes i had some stuff happen in school that was quite embarrassing and due to me being unhappy im fucked for the future with shite school results and me never really being capable to do much better i dont know if i can go really much further like this id rather just have what happened to one of my favourite tv showbook character and then id be fine,1
i hate how people boast about how much they support mental illness then once they meet a mentally ill person they want nothing to do with them its just so fucking tiresome you see it everywhere on social media people will go on and on and on about how we should all reach out to mentally ill people then when you have the courage to reach out to them the same fucking people will tell you bullshit like man up stop being so sensitive hey bro at least youre not a starving child in africa bro its just your mindset you gotta start thinking more positively and so on like whats the fucking point whenever we do reach out we either get scolded or our problems get dismissed im not trying to say this is how it is for everyone but this is just from my experiences i just want someone to fucking listen just once and for once i want to be able to tell someone about this without fear of eventually getting ghosted is that asking for too much,1

is life only about distracting myself until i die so its been like that for 5 years and ive been telling myself over and over again that it would get better with time but i dont think anymore that it will nor do i know if id actually want it to be better the whole covid thing made it way harder to distract myself as much as i did before which made me realise how my life really looked like is there really a point in living a life in which i only look to the things that happened in the past and ignore the present day as well as the future is this really what my life have become,1
tired of it faking having a good time just to please others takes a lot of energy,1
ive been in quarantine in my head for 2 years ive been stuck living in my head and it doesnt seem like im getting out anytime soon,1
nobody wants to deal with negative people you really have to be careful with what you say around coworkers friends and family if youre not always a ray of sunshine you become the negative depressed person who is no fun to be around at the end of the day no one really gives a shit about what youre dealing with if youre not being positive and smiling no matter the reason they have a problem with you i wish there wasnt a constant pressure to be happy and outgoing it is exhausting to hear comments about your demeanor,1
i am so fucking sick i am a 15 year old in a shit arab country i have no friends i dont know how or where to make friends and i am sick of opening every fucking social media and seeing people the same age enjoying life and i dont have anyone to talk to i hate everything about myself its to the point where i have no confidence i cant talk to people normally i either stutter or lower my voice i am addicted to pornogrphy and i have no hobbies or passions i cant do things because i have no energy or power and i wake up everyday like 1 pm i cant handle this anymore,1
i believe i am going to die alone and incessant thoughts are slowly making me want to kill myself 25 m no one in my family or close extended family gives a shit about me to them i am a liability a burden i am average looking with no personality or skills and suffer from social anxiety i dont know how to talk to people and as such i have never able to connect with anyone i believe i am handicapped like this i am broke in a dead end job dont have any hobbies have made zero friends in the past decade havent experienced a womans touch and i believe i am unlikely ever to its not the fact that i havent yet made any friends or never had a girlfriend but the fact that whatever little connection i manage to make it fizzles out quickly becs like i said i simply dont know how to connect with anyone as such i believe i will most likely die all alone with never having experienced affection ever in my worthless life,1
you can check out any time you like but you can never leave everything i do in my life always brings me back to this song lyric it describes depression better than anything else you can think youre okay but youre never okay everything is always the same no matter what you do,1
anyone else feel like falling asleep and not waking up in laying here about to sleep and every night i have the mantra in my head of that i hope i never wake up i dont want to kill myself but id rather just never wake up again that way no one will be mad at me for dying by my own hand that way i cant disappoint anyone anymore anyone else,1
perhaps whats worse than depression is not being able to realize if youre having the best time of your life or the worst because it all feels the same im having a really hard time keeping up with life especially since the lockdown started i just dont feel like i have anything to live for i do not want to be happy i just dont understand what happiness is to be completely honest that is not to say that im unhappy and miserable what im saying is that happiness and sadness has become the same thing for me i just cant separate the two on top of that theres this feeling of guilt i keep having about everything i am from a rich family people have always expected me to be on top of everything ever since i learned to walk but i was never able to be on top ive always sucked at everything i tried to be on top but never made it and so now im this 21 year old uni student and ive been hammered so much with that mindset of trying to get to be best at everything and since ive always failed at that i feel safer as a failure i just do not feel that i want to succeed ive become an emotional masochist sometimes i imagine that a loved one would come and choke me to death to put me out of this misery and leave me in a cold dead end where no one would ever come across again thats not to say im suicidal i am not i just like having those kinds of imaginations the only thing i do to keep my mind off of these feelings these days is that i listen to music even my genres are new age or shoegazing or doom metal which used to be uplifting epic music now im not going too much into that stuff but i hope ive made my point clear im not looking for concrete advice perhaps simply writing these down and sharing might help me a lot thank you for taking the time to read through this whole post i truly appreciate it,1
hi i love dragons and tiny things and moments make me happy i really love dragons and other fantasy creatures but dragons the most ive started asking people to draw me a dragon if they ever have a little time on their hand to do so i absolutely love all of the drawings most of the people i ask are hesitant because they claim they cant draw but its not true i assure them that they can draw a dragon or a fantasy creature of their choice in any way they want and i will not judge ill always be happy they tried ive gotten so many dragons about 10 right now and i love how unique and different they are from each other each reminds me of the person that drew it and i just cannot describe how happy i am that some people dedicated minutes or even hours of their days to make me a drawing ive mostly asked friends but also family and a few internet friends too and they all did amazing some do a simple design some have a more complicated one there are cute dragons fierce dragons silly dragons a couple new creatures some with colors some without my mom did one and my brother too and it took some convincing to make them do it but they did and i could see that they smiled too when i lit up,0
friend and i shared our first deeply sexual experiences and i am incredibly honored by how safe and comfortable she felt me and a really close friend just shared our first deeply sexual experiences after a whole day of cuddling and deep conversation we talked about everythingand felt like we didnt have to hide anything from eachother one thing led to another and we felt comfortable to do just about everything but get to home base god she was beautiful id never felt more accepted and understood we frequently checked on eachother to make sure we were still comfortable and asked for consent for everything shes been pressured to do things in the past and even though were just friends she told me this was the safest and most comfortable she ever felt and holy fuck that is an amazing thing to hear i really care about her and im so incredibly grateful to have a friend like her,0

i can overhear my mother on the phone laughing and joking about my depression to her friend saying things like shes so emotional hahaha and telling her friend everything i just said that was making me upset everything about me is just a joke to her just a topic of discussion for her to gawk over i dont even know why im crying what else should i expect from someone who hasnt ever given me any kind of legitimate emotion support,1

how do i stop stressing out about things out of my control im a step mom and i have to constantly go from worrying about my step kids being abused physically emotionally and via neglect by their bio mom to then having to worry about myself and my boyfriend dealing with their emotional breakdowns and extremely hurtful comments that just tear you apart i have to watch my boyfriend being taken advantage of and disrespected by his family that we cant get out of our lives because we are financially dependent on them due to covid and my partner being too hurt to work right now theres literally nothing i can do about any of these things except wait and survive what do i do to stop stressing myself out to the point of throwing up,1
is it just me or do the cons outweigh the pros in life it may just be the depression talking but i seriously think that there is more bad than good in this life we live,1
feeling really useless ive always been a lurker or casual commenter here so heres my first post this lockdown has really exacerbated my depression tho the culprit really is just being in a human society lol i feel isolated and alone ive opened up to a few people but i always end up sounding like a broken record and people say the same shallow things to console me so i just stopped talking to the people around me about feeling depressed my depression has led me to quitting my job trust me i wasnt far from getting let go so i quit before it got real bad i worked in a creative industry and the burnout feels permanent and i struggle to make money freelance pays so little and im living off my life savings which is not much plus my art isnt even doing well my works are ignored or even if i get a commission or freelance project i get paid less than minimum wage ive learnt to say no and i do negotiate my rates but the desperation has caused me to just do what i can to stay afloat im almost 30 so being a crybaby about it just paints myself as immature to those around me never gonna be able to afford a house car kids i dont have the capacity to handle most jobs but i did try my best before this most days i have sleep and tears for dinner i always forget to shower and brush my teeth my partner is stuck overseas indefinitely so ive lost my strongest support system the pain and loss i feel on a daily basis is unbearable some days i wish i had the guts to just end my life but instead i just wallow in my own sadness and filth i dont even know what would make me happy or at least dull the pain a little maybe some company and a bit of help here and there would make it a bit better but i know id still feel dead inside and therapy i cant afford it plus i know how therapists console people im sure some of you relate to that thing you do where you have a rebuttal for every advice given ive been the therapist friend only just speaking from experience theres no point to this post just letting it out of my chest,1

leaving i dont know how to stop the flow of hatred in my heart despite life not being bad for me at the moment i get odddeep senses of dissatisfaction within myself and begin to slowly pull back from literally anything and anybody thats currently in my life it always makes sense to me that itll be easier to leave if less people care and are impacted by my decision i know people love and care about me and emphasize they want me here and it weighs on me continuously but i cant help but think everyones lives will be easier and much happier if im not around as of recent ive been subconsciously pushing away my closest relationships not intentionally but it feels my emotions have been making the decisions for me im much closer to leaving than i normally am im scared and i dont know what to do im stuck between stopping myself from being unhappy and being completely selfless,1
im black im scared tired and im at the end of my rope with life jesus how do i even start as you could read by the title im a black man ive always been in the fight grew up with racism in all its forms in my country which ironically usually denies there ever being racism in any way the kind of shit ive heard through my entire life has molded me into someone with no selfesteem sense of selfworth voice and made into introvert because of the mentality of you need to work twice as hard as everyone out there i always saw the future as bleak tiresome and as more struggle this never really changed it just got worse with time with college and the awful reality that came afterwards ive been depressed for most of my life with my initial diagnosis at age 9 i still have it with severe anxiety my first suicidal thoughts came at age 8 and then and there i already hated myself for everything for not being enough for not being what the world wanted for failing myself at being the best for never getting anything good out of my own life for never letting myself rest or be human and with all the recent events like the absurd police brutality worldwide the rise of authoritarianism in my country with being worked to the bone and around the clock due to the pandemic with my country quickly moving up to be the worst afflicted by covid19 and my mom and me being in danger during these times by living in a neighbourhood near a place where a white supremacist parade happened which also happens to be a place where a lot of people are simply disrespecting quarantine all of this shit is just wearing me down really badly i wake up exhausted i cant deal with anything without having a serious bout of anxiety or anger outbursts followed by fullscale breakdowns im feeling guilty by worrying my friends and my mom i feel guilty by feeling tired by feeling afraid i feel guilty by not feeling brave enough to go out on the streets for my people and taking action i feel guilty for existing im so fucking exhausted and i dont know what to do i just want it all to end i just wanna go somewhere else i cant handle anything anymore edit all of this support im very very thankful for it i think ive never felt this supported in my whole life all of your words have touched me deeply im so glad you helped me i feel more hopeful more energized from talking to you all thank you thank you all from the bottom of my heart youve all stopped me from doing something terrible today thank you edit 2 wow i was not expecting this kind of response from so many people im trying to respond to everyone but i think i cant id like to thank you all once more for all your words im very glad that i vented about all these feelings here with you all i feel so much support from you and i feel like my feelings are valid and worth feeling it may seem a bit dramatic but im legitimately walking out of this with a different outlook on life i never expected to see so many people i dont know just rush in to support me when im in my absolute worst so thank you once more for being here for me i mean it i love you all,1

being depressed and having depression are different i have clinical depression i was diagnosed about 5 years ago it really hits me hard sometimes one of my friends does not understand that people can 100 get depressed because of nothing she thinks people only get depressed for a specific reason such as someone passing away or a horrible break up and those things are awful those feelings are valid and the literal worst but she doesnt understand that people can just be depressed for basically no reason at all im currently having a depressive episode nothings wrong i just cant get out of bed i cant do the dishes i cant pick up the takeout off my bedroom floor i cant i just i cant hear the but why are you depressed question one more time fortunately and unfortunately ive been dealing with this illness for long enough that i know that this feeling will end and i know how to somewhat manage it but if she were to say that to someone else i just worry that it could end someones life anyway thats all im sure no one will even read this k bye edit im really happy this post caused some awesome conversations hopefully made people feel less alone in the fact that you can be depressed about nothing smilingfacewithhearts,1

february 22nd 2020 i almost killed myself this past saturday im not sure if i was fully committed but i was invested enough to write a note tidy up my room and pick out which pills i was going to use to do it my last cry for help was me sending my goodbye messages to my loved ones i mustve subconsciously known someone would come rescue me from myself my friend came my roommate came my mother came i took 6 pills but what i didnt tell them that i kept slipping myself more i knew i wouldnt die but i wanted to come close i wanted to know if death was truly what i wanted and if i got it i suppose my choice wouldve been made either way my dad whom i love dearly flew in to be near me and i so very much appreciate it but to be quite honest i dont think this will be the last time i do this i just dont feel much except weariness anymore and im tired to anyone reading this that may happen to know me irl by some miracle of a chance thank you for being there for me,1

is it the new implant i got or is it stress please help me so a few things have started to happen that has caused me to have the worst mental breakdown ive ever had at work but i want to know how theyre related if they are the cause and how i can fix it 1 to start off i have depression and anxiety i take medication for it and ive not had a problem with them since meds work pretty well 2 for the past 2 months ive been dealing with stress at work with a boss who hardly comes in and employees that dont do their job correctly i also have problems with clients that arent happy with how we control things and dogs that shouldnt be at daycare doggy daycare i have to deal with people that cant do their job and i have to work extra hard to cover for them we do not have a manager as its her business 3 my mother has recently been diagnosed with cancer i live 1000 miles away and finally got to see her after 3 12 months of being away sister had a wedding in august so i was away for about 8months due to the pandemic she has stage 3 and is on radiation and chemo it was the first time i seen her look so weak exhausted in pain and grouchy i didnt want to leave my mom even though my dad is taking care of her and i only got to see her for a week before me and my bf had to go back to our home state i am very very very close to my mom so all of this and departing from her really broke my heart 4 im very sensitive but i can hold my own you could say im very sweet supportive but also been isolated from life since i lived most of it in the country i dont know certain things and my bf gets very impatient and frustrated with me when i dont explain things fully or have trouble with things and actions that are common sense 5 i have diagnosed adhd and take a large amount of medication for it sometime my medicine doesnt kick in properly making my brain foggy and my way of thinking is all over the place this makes my bf upset when he doesnt get why im talking so weirdly or all over the place 6 and lastly on december 16th of this year i switched over to a new form of birth control nexplanon or birth control implant the one that goes in your arm ive been spotting irregularly breaking out like mad face usually is clean and clear as a whistle and i feel like im crying more than ever before although it does seem like its my implant i feel like there is more to this story right now i usually keep my composure when ever my bf gets frustrated annoyed or angry with me i keep it pretty well together however tonight he got frustrated with me not raising his voice nothing that shows anger andi felt like bawling like super hard core bawling this is not normal my sleep eating drinking everything else is fine nothing is bothering me that usually does everything is normal but for some reason i feel like anything could set me off im afraid to go into work and im afraid im gonna get fired please anyone out there tell me whats wrong i really need to know im desperate,1
so stressed about bad decision at work i work for an insurance company and my job is to acceptdecline applicants based on their risk this one policy is high risk and the agent talked me into giving them more time to fix the issue nothing has happened yet but the extension is for a year now im overwhelmed with the feeling that a large loss will happen and itll be all my fault i know i made a bad decision and theres nothing i can do now but i dont know how im going to cope with the dread and physical symptoms racing heart tight chest overthinking and feeling that i let everyone down for a year my boss basically said it is what it is but i could tell she was disappointed,1
i wish i can turn off that part of my brain that says i am worthless everytime i get a compliment my brain says its fake i just hate myself,1
time management hello can anyone tell me how can i manage my time effectively,0
hate myself ive been bullied my whole life and now thats it covid im being judged by my older sister at home and it hurts me deep down around her i cant act like myself because im scared of being judged and made fun of she made me hate myself to the point i dont even wanna be here she gets her happiness with my flaws and it kills me inside i hate myself i dont even wanna be here anymore,1
im tired all the time im always tired all the time even if i manage to get a week of good sleep eat 3 meals with all the food groups take a two week relaxation staycation finish that big project so i can breathe pour my feeling all over a trusted friend game drink coffee in my pjs all weekend take daily neighborhood walks for a week explore green spaces to decompress reduce weekly screen time to a minimum take more time to cherish lifes moments slowly im still tired im still tired all the time,1
can you forget you have depression i know that sounds kinda dumb im a bit confused and over thinking does anyone relate to this feeling like when you get betterin recovery and then nothing is wrong never has been everythings fine and all that shit before was just made up and never happened it gets played down and trivialized not by anyone else but in your own mind ive gone through cycles of depression for years and whenever i feel better i seem to forget just how bad it was or like im in denial or something but then i think its not that bad surely if i can feel so good and like the world is in hd again also when talking to anyone about my depression i just want to laugh at the absurdity of it i dont like talking about it sometimes because im worried people might think im making it up or worse take what i say at face value and believe me i think im making it up its a big joke its emotional whiplash but i do feel like this when im alone so how can it be a performance and made up i live like a hermit and have pushed everyone away and dont really connect emotionally anymore i feel its all rather dramatic,1
feeling security and safety in depression do people ever experience this its like you almost want to be depressed because for some reason it gives you a twisted sense of security your brain just wants to stay in that bad place and it takes too much energy to get out,1
no money im in debt and about to be homeless but i still got weed living with my gfs dad right now although im about to break up with the gf so ill be homeless soon with no money and in medical debt its crazy how fast people can change or just lie to you the whole time who knows which one it is id get professional help but i cant even commit to that for many reasons so i guess ill just sit here and smoke until it hurts and my feelings are numb again cheers to depression,1
im going to kill myself maybe not today maybe not tomorrow maybe not in ten years but i have a burning feeling inside of me that my life will end on my own terms when i am ready and i dont know how i feel about it,1
i want to bleed to death i have a fantasy of bleeding to death and sitting in my blood for the past week all i can think of is suicide 247 i keep googling and researching it i want to be dead so fucking bad i want slash my wrist and bathe in my blood i keep thinking about killing myself how am i supposed to function while i want to be dead how am i gonna study and do homework with all these thoughts and self hatred i cant see myself being over 20 i dont want to participate in society work a 95 job so i can live my miserable life im just 16 now but the adult life is scaring the shit out of me i certainly go by old age the only way that i will die is suicide sooner or later,1
i wouldnt commit suicide but if i had an option to suddenly stop existing i would choose it does anyone else feel this way this has been crossing my mind a lot lately edit i just want to thank everyone for the thoughtful kind comments ive been recieving its been a nice change and i really appreciate it you guys are the best,1
anyone masturbate as means to deal with depression ive been dealing with depression for a number of years now i find masturbation as a temporary relief of that feeling does anyone else feel this way,1
what does it mean when you dream about work every time you sleep i work overtime almost every single day at the animal hospital i come home and work on other stuff watch hulu and try to unwind but when i go to sleep i get nightmares and dreams about work most of it is nonsensical and a regurgitation of the last few daysweeks they cause me to wake up in which my mind of buzzing and booming with work related things im not sure how to make it stop but its causing me to wear out before i even get to work,1
almost hit someone in a crosswalk im shaking i was going through town at 25 mph in my lifted tacoma with larger tires and had to completely stomp on the brakes i barely saw this college student walk through the intersection and he kept walking even with me slamming the brakes my god i came within like 68ft of hitting this guy i cant stop checking my truck for damage even though i didnt hit him also my breathing and sweaty hands cant calm down neither my heart rate,1
i won my first game of bedwars legitimately after months of raging and crying cause of stress i finally won my first game of bedwars a lot has happened and im happy that this one good thing happened to me,0
i never realized it but i always used to try to make other people laugh and smile because i never wanted them to go through what im going through right now funny how none of those people are making the same attempt for me looking back on it its kind of funny no one wants to be around a sad person so you fake being happy to keep them in good spirits and not be alone the charade works so well that no one would actually think youre suffering inside a ridiculous catch22 isnt it i was like a frowning clown with a smile painted on and now the years of caked on face paint has started to crack revealing nothing but an empty expression underneath completely blank and hollow its as if my face has been wiped away withered to dust,1
the way i looked at my depression helped me tremendously i see depression being regarded as a monster a beast a fight and a crushing weight and i too for many years viewed it in those ways it was hard and at times i felt as i could not escape one day at my absolute lowest i decided to change my perspective on it just to see if it would even make a difference boy did it for me i looked at it like an amusement park and roller coasters you can sorta guess how this goes but please allow me to explain walking through the park at that level we feel our baseline normal the rides represent our mental and emotional highs and lows in life everyone walks through the park for some thats all they do and they are content others get on the gentler rides they experience both highs and lows but not to extremes again still content then there are the coasters many people get on them and then never again others keep riding their favorite one for me i was the one rushing between all of them running through the park to catch the next not staying in my baseline for very long my depression shared a relationship with those roller coasters never staying the same and some bigger or scarier than others seeing the highest points between the drop of pure passionate joy the lows with twists and turns leaving me in fear and then returning to the station filled with gratitude that its over safely but heres were i saw beauty in thismy life is passionate those high points i feel so deeply those lows as well but its exhilarating through it all and i know ill return to the station safe and sound bringing friends and family to share in the beautiful moments and hold your hand through the scary recognizing my support system that way feels wonderful and lets not forget therapy or medication personally unmedicated but open to it i look at them like other riders especially ones you just cant help but laugh or giggle at when they are over the top or cracking jokes they help make those fearful moments really not so bad i just wanted to share this with whomever decides to read this just looking at my depression in a different way helped me tremendously in acknowledging and moving forward in where i am and how to handle the difficult times does anyone else have any similar methods that helped,1
i want to commit suicide soon i have no one to talk to about this let me vent here i have leftover medicines i can overdose on i just dont know if i need to buy some alcohol so its more fatal i had this strong urge to drink them all last night but stopped because my partner in a project tomorrow messaged me if i were to go last night id bring trouble to her as i have to bring some items ill probably do it after that project is done tomorrow and if i still feel the same last night another friend told me about when they tried overdosing and waking up feeling asphyxiated i played this game where we sent messages anonymously about our feelings and reread an old message where a stranger said they tried overdosing but lived on to regret it but now im still feeling empty and want to end it all this decision is powered by how i feel like people who i thought were close to me didnt care instead they didnt reach me out they stopped replying to my chat even knowing i felt suicidal because its already night and they want to sleep maybe im selfish for wanting them to stay and comfort me its the weekend and theres no work to do maybe they think i wont do it as its not my first time expressing my suicidal tendencies been up and down for 2 years but never really tried because i want to really pass away on my first try i believe even if i were to go they wont care or they might feel sad for a while and then it will all be better things are bad for me every single aspect of my life i feel no happiness being alive two years ago i said id try and see if things would change here i am now nothing really changes should have ended my life years ago i dont live in the usa so my only concern is how do i give my belongings and bank account without a formal will i already composed a will 2 years ago saved in my laptop i will update it before i go and hope someone can find it and exact my will for me life is just not for me,1
alone by choice spent the day alone today instead of socializing with peers at college i felt at peace but also sad i know this is my own choice and its for the best i forget that sometimes,1
im so incredibly horrified by this world i wish i could leave this universe i suffer from anxiety and depression and have been going through a pretty tough and pretty long episode i havent had one in a long while which is probably why its so bad this time the chaos in the world right now triggered it and now everything is blowing up in my mind like im overthinking and over analyzing everything but rather than feel extreme anxiety over this i feel rather numb and just just so so sad,1
on a scale of 1 to 10 how bad is daily suicidal ideation also if any happy times or feelings arise during selfassumed depression dors that still mean i am depressed ive gotten so used to them that i dont even worry about them anymore also it isnt correct to say daily rather multiple times per day for months 4 months to date to be exact ive never sought formal help nor do i have someone i trust enough to elaborate on my problems so i am not sure how long i have been depressed or what the intensity of it was like anyone else even when i thought i was depressed there were still some happy moments in there somewhere as such i also have a second question if any period of happiness is experienced during a period or periods of selfdiagnosed depression does that mean i am not depressed,1
having covid has revealed to me what i really am thankfully i am able to hide it from others so only i know the decaying disease in my thoughts heart and soul if there were justice covid would take me protecting those from me but cruelly covid requires me to fight it in order to help one of those get well i know this is cryptic there is a lack of humanity within me a massive selfishness about me even when i concentrate on what it ultimately good for others i still find an essence of being self centered thinking how it benefits me how am i able to care but then again care but not care and the first care in that sentence in reality provides me nothing tangible while the care not care would take away everything tangible what is missing inside of me to be this way thanks for listening to my rambling,1
please dont tell me it will get better sometimes i dont want to hear it will get better because i dont see it and i dont believe it sometimes i just want someone to sit with me in silence or to listen to me and comfort me or just laugh with me i dont know if anyone else feels like this but i doand also i just want one day where i dont want to die edit i most likely wont reply to many people but i am reading them all edit if you are being rude and disrespectful to others on this post i will respond with a prompt f you and you will be free to take full offense and i hope you leave anybody else you are doing great sooo another edit umm i might begetting suspended because i was trying to get a rude user away from you guys because he was being a bully and saying meanhurtful things and he took this a verbal abuse idk whenif i will or how long i just want you all to knoe that i love you all and you have lifted my spirit,1
how common is it for depressed people to lay in bed all day and not work out i pretty much spent the majority of my early 20s doing exactly that eating fast food laying in bed and just getting by in life,1
i am starting to become depressed again sometimes i feel so insane with how swiftly my emotions change i feel everything so tremendously deep and when the smallest good thing happens as small as someone holding the door for me or a stranger complimenting my outfit i feel a strong surge of motivation to make my life better and the good instant happens it consumes me for a couples hours or days depending on what it is and cheers me up some but all those small good things are irrelevant and mean nothing so as soon as enough time passes i drop way back down into my depression when i am living at home it is really easy to focus on me and only care about doing stuff to better myself and prepare to have a successful future however at college it is not so easy to ignore how lonely and misunderstood i am seeing how my life should be makes it so much harder to accept this is who i am and i will always be alone and that that is ok,1

i dont know how to be a college student im a first generation college student firstborn in us first in family to go to college pursuing an engineering degree who has no idea what the hell is going on i messed up a lot last semester and ended with a belowaverage gpa and this semester things are slightly better but im still nowhere near where i should be im studying and going to classes from the morning until 1 or 2 am every day and im still not doing as well as all my friends im constantly sad and stressed out and i dont know what to do i feel like a complete failure ive been paying for college on my own and at this point im just trying so hard just so keep the scholarships i have my mom wants to get a second job so she can help me pay for my school but its the last thing i want her to do to pay for college this summer i have to work 45 hours a week for three months on top of summer classes calculus and physics so i dont stay behind in the curriculum and graduate in four years my entire academic life is a huge mess and i have no idea how to deal with it its gotten to the point where its all i think about to the point where i now have depression and anxiety and i havent told anyone about it i dont know how to deal with all of this,1
i envy people who can afford to be happy currently i cant afford being happy nor extreme happiness anymore every time i experience something to be happy about when it tones down it goes down hard i feel extreme depression after that but when i feel neutral it just continues not happy but at least not feeling the depression i dont know what to do because i genuinely enjoy the happiness whenever it is happening but i also know im going to crash hard after that so now i just try not to feel extreme happiness and continue being neutral just so i wouldnt crash just last night i really enjoyed my time hanging out with my close friend and its not even euphoric i was just glad that time but now i crashed and i dont know what to do ps english is not my first language,1
how do i plan for burnout while also hiding the burnout from others ive been stressed lately due to overworking and other things i think im at the point where im not gonna escape the eventual burnout its just a matter of being prepared and wondering when its going to happen so how do i prepare myself what loose ends do i need to tie before i dont care for an unforeseeable amount of time ive already prepared some stuff that will release online on a schedule i make content online and how do i do it without anyone in my family catching on that something is wrong i know i shouldnt hide it but id rather not let them know,1
old heartbreaks can eventually just be nice memories im sure that this doesnt apply to every situation but it made me happy to think about today i thought about my first girlfriend this morning it was actually because of hearing a song we used to listen to all the time just driving around our little home town we were both 16 when we met and we were together for nearly 2 years it was a classic story she got into college in a different state i couldnt afford to go to college yet we planned to stay together long distance and it lasted about 3 months breaking up with her ruined both of us at the time of course for a few months that first person you fall in love with does a number on you i was pretty miserable for a while for years when i thought about it it would make me a little sad especially if i was single at the time then i really never thought about it at all this was probably the first time i thought about her in as long as i can remember maybe years im 30 now this time though i didnt feel sad at all everything i remembered was a happy memory the first time we kissed which was the first time either of us had kissed anyone doing absolutely everything together sneaking out just to see each other for a few minutes climbing an old fire tower in our town laying out in a field under the stars together falling asleep together for the first time carrying her around for no reason planning all the trips we would never end up going on together also just that overwhelming feeling of wanting to be near someone and the joy id feel when her car would pull up or when she would walk out of her front door to meet me its all just nice fun stuff and it doesnt really matter to me anymore that it didnt work out and i dont really remember the painful part of it ending im just glad it happened it was probably the best part of my childhood and young adult years and you cant get that back in my mind she was the most beautiful smartest and funniest person i had ever met and i couldnt believe when all those feelings were reciprocated even if it didnt last we loved each other not everyone gets to experience being in love with someone at 17 its such a pure and simple thing and i think im pretty lucky,1

just a bunch of first world problems im a freshman in college i was one of those people who did well in high school without really trying i knew it would be harder coming into college but a great first semester pulled me into a false sense of security im currently sitting on a 31 seriously why are bs so fucking detrimental this would be fineish since im a comm major and nobody in my field of work especially in my city gives a shit about your academics in college you can either do the job or you cant problem is my scholarships and aid are riding on my grades i cant afford to go to college without them i never learnt proper studying or time management skills so im trying desperately to catch up but im being buried under classes orgs and general life responsibilities i stupidly thought that managing 12 hrs with only one class that has tests and no orgs meant i could do 15 hrs with three classes that test haha nope i joined four orgs and paid the dues for all of them two of them i never attend because i dont have time so thats 80 down the toilet one of them wants too much time and the other is confusing and point opportunities are hard to come by for the past two weeks the meetings that normally go until 8 30 have been running up on 10 30 instead im trying to take care of things that would actually help me like doctor and psych appointments doing this means im missing classes meaning my grades suffer im not seeing a therapist anymore because i dont have time there are so many things i have to do fees i have to pay papers i have to fill etc and i cant do them all my family says exercise and eat well in what time how do i stick to my calories when im constantly binging from stress im getting back to my old weight and i hate it i cant stand the idea of anyone seeing me naked so a love life as if id have time for it is out of the question ill spend all day working and then realize i accomplished almost nothing because i was agonizing over a single task but i need to be a perfectionist with these things because they are such a huge part of my grade none of the things i do are interesting to me im in an english and theatre course and i either hate them or cant give them the dedication i want despite the fact that i love those subjects after every test i make a plan to study better but it quickly gets thrown to the wayside as other shit is piled onto my plate so now im cramming and stressing my room is a disaster my side is always dirty because im too overwhelmed to pick it up my roommate is a super light sleeper so i have to go to bed before i can finish my stuff just so she can get her sleep and its not her fault but i just want to yell im sorry you cant sleep but i have shit to do let me fix my shitty gpa while you enjoy your 39 thanks this isnt the half of it but what i can get down before i have to get back to work im sure some of these things have easy solutions but im too blinded by my stress sadness frustration everything i welcome any advice anyone may have these problems are stupid and unimportant in the grand scheme of things but i cant ignore them thank you to anyone who took the time to read this and just see me and how i feel,1

my therapist committed suicide last week my long time therapist committed suicide and i dont know how to cope i feel so alone this wasnt just some therapist off the street he was highly educated well respected and worked with a few institutions selfishly i feel hurt and abandoned everyone is telling me to find a new therapist but not only does that feel like a close friend died get a new friend but so much trust was broken i dont want to open up to a new therapist the thought that keeps running through my mind is if someone who dedicated his life to mental health and had so many resources couldnt get better what hope do i have and also selfishly how could he i know mental health is a beast and i know from his brief mentioning that he was fighting demons but it feels so unfair like my symbol of recovery has been destroyed thanks for listening,1

is it stress or is our relationship dead my fianc is constantly stressed about work for at least the last year hes so stressed that he throws up in the mornings and has work related nightmares and sleep shouts he hates his colleagues his work and he comes home in a foul mood i try my best not to take things personally but hes lost all interest in me and pushes me away both emotionally and physically his excuse is always im tired he tells me he loves me but then dismisses me if i have an opinion or request or any interaction with him he used to be sweet sending me cute selfies and giving me compliments now our interaction is mostly food related unless its the weekend in which case were probably arguing im exhausted fighting with him he says hurtful things which make me think this relationship is dead like just when i thought this relationship was going to work you start another fight also his lack of desire to plan our future our wedding our children instead its im tired you only want kids because your friends have them i cant plan ahead it gives me anxiety i dont know what to make of it how much is stress and i just need to be more understanding and how much is just him not really wanting the relationship anymore,1
how to deal with debilitating stress at work hi all im new around here but think we can all use a safe space to talk about stress and over advice i need some advice i started a new job about two months ago things were going well for the first month i struggle a lot with stress at work holding myself to high expectations and inability to deal when i mess up but was using this opportunity to focus on changing my internal thoughts re work then covid19 hit and i started working remotely it went well at first but the last two weeks a lot has been happening in my personal life and i feel stressed to that point that i can barely function much less focus on work and its hard being at home and unable to separate my work life from my personal life this week it finally got bad enough that i talked to my boss and coworkers about it as i know my ability to work has suffered i make lots of small mistakes forget things have constant headaches cant remember what ive done etc my brain basically feels like its broken my boss said to be easy on myself but to make sure that im doing good work and contributing value to the organization i know she cares that im struggling but also has high expectations shes frustrated and i am too but im truly at a loss of what to do its a small team so asking to take on fewer responsibilities doesnt seem like an option and id feel selfish doing that so soon into my new position but i dont feel like i can keep doing this any advice either for helping with focus or talking with my boss thank you,1

back in the fog again didnt think id be back here again as i thought things in my life were suddenly looking up im currently a semiprofessional athlete whos looking to make it fulltime its been my dream for a very long time and to people on the outside it looking that way however due to injury plus the pandemic ive effectively missed two years of playing im 26m and i feel like ive put in a lot of time and effort for very little return it makes me feel as though ive wasted a lot of time focussing on this one thing and seriously brings me down coupled with that ive been battling serious anxiety issues since i was in primary school i worry loads about the future and struggle to think far ahead ive pursued sports relentlessly as it was the only thing that gave me pure joy and what i thought i was good at also making it would provide significant financial reward seeing friends on social media excel in their respective careers and enjoy life has made me feel as though ive wasted a lot of time and adds to my depression it also makes me feel as though im not as worth much to people because im not doing big thing so im not good enough to be around them and more importantly im not worth much to myself since i was young ive never really had people think i could amount to much aside from my mum of whom i extremely want to make proud but overall it has hugely imlacted my mental health to points where i doubt myself and end up asking myself if ive even learnt anything during my time of living i also feel as though since were now slowly coming out of the pandemic life as gotten better for most which is good but somehow worse for me which may be naive to think but it appears to be that way to the point whereby i struggle to have simple conversations with people i dont find things as funny anymore and my attention to detail on things has gone out the window i even feel when writing this message im not articulating myself the best as my brain is in a fog at the moment doing things such as getting out of bed is becoming an issue but i feel bad each time if im wasting time im struggling to make sense with reality and its becoming very overwhelming i dont have money to see a therapist as i quit my job in sales due to the stress it was bringing and the way it was affecting my performance in sport overall ive some how wound up in another depressive episode and it seems to be the worst i thought i was mentally becoming more resilient after okay for a good amount of time but i just feel lost and confused and its all happening at a time when things should be going well for people who have experience dealing with this or can relate to this situation in any type of way what did you do to cope with it and change your lives for the better and permanent,1

just because someone has it worse than you doesnt mean that your problems dont matter if something upsets you bothers you hurts you makes you uncomfortable then it matters just because soandso has problems that seem worse than yours it doesnt make your issues invalid it kills me when someone opens up and talks about what going wrong in their life and the person theyre talking to says well at least it isnt any worse that makes me feel so little and like an annoying complainer because obviously my life isnt actually that bad,1

losing my house but im going to be okay dear kind souls of reddit i am furious and under a huge amount of stress right now but i am going to be okay i would appreciate some words of wisdom and good vibes going my way i bought a mobile home on its own lot in 2016 i got the home inspected prior to purchasing it and i got house insurance and title insurance after i moved in i began to have problems with the water line freezing and breaking every winter i have spent around 4000 in repairs over the past two years and i think i have finally solved the problem my sewer stopped working properly in march of this year and i have had to dismantle most of the sewer underneath the house to solve the problem the plumber and i put a camera down and we found an unknown blockage somewhere close to the street i ended up having to dig up my driveway break the sewer and put the camera throughonly to find that the sewer is clean the sewer cleaner said that it was probably frozen and he has been to my house to thaw the sewer when the previous owners owned it in order to fix the broken pipe the plumber is going to have to dig down underneath the mobile home to connect to the iron sewer that is under there and in order to do this i will have to completely remove my house fix the sewer and then put my house back on my property the total bill for this will be around 10000 and it is at the point where i am ready to just get a new house i will be living paycheck to paycheck in a new house but i dont really have many options i would not have bought this house if i had known all of the problems that came with it and insurance wont cover any of this i have proof that the previous owners knew about the water line freezing but i have no proof that they knew anything about the sewer freezing i havent been able to sleep properly for several months i am under so much stress and i am furious i have been living in a hotel since march while i am still stuck paying a mortgage on property tax on a house that i cant live in why does the world work this way,1
how the fuck do people find things they actually like and stick with it one of the big pieces of advice i see for depressed people online is to find a hobby or find something fulfilling i can see how this would be a great piece of advice if it actually worked for me any time i pick something new up i kind of enjoy it keep doing it for a few weeks maybe even a month if im lucky get bored and then stop rinse and repeat every goddamn time ive tried the gym running tennis football photography hell even playing video games i get bored of eventually maybe its because of my depression but i really struggle to find something i actually enjoy to the point of wanting to do it as much as possible over a long period of time most things that i find which i genuinely enjoy my enjoymentdetermination fizzles out after a few weeks to the point where my effort put in outweighs my enjoyment so i just stop how do people find things they enjoy and actually want to stick with it for a long period of time anyone have any advice,1

whats the real problem with me ive always wondered why i never had any friends its been an unfortunate consistency throughout my life im moderately attractive with good personal hygenie im very generous with my time and money i will bend over backwards for the people in my life that i care about and love im genuine honest trustworthy empathetic compassionate and loyal however nobody wants to be my friendnot even when i was a child im almost 53 years old and have never had a best friend that i could trust and rely on ive had people that i knew at work or school and we seemed to get along well enough however they would never accept my invites to go hang out and do fun things together ive heard that if the problem is across people that means everywhere you go and all the people you meetthen its you in the beginning i brushed it off and thought i was just dealing with a bad person or our personalities didnt match upetc butnow that im nearly 53 the issue seems much deeper and im trying to unravel the true issue here ive had really nice cars and a nice house to host a party or social eventnobody agrees to come over they are all too busyall the time its always some excuse as to why they arent available ive become extremely aware of my myself emotionally and ive taken the time to listen to others i will hear someone say no to me but theni will hear them agree to hang out with another person and the excuse they gave me never came up example i will ask someone to go to a movie and they will say something likei just have too much to do thanks for the invite but maybe another time another person will ask them to do something on the same day and they will say sureyeah i would really like that sounds like fun ill see you at 7 30 i scratch my head and think what is so bad about me that nobody wants to spend time with me that type of thing has happened more times than i can count ive even started to experiment with things and sayhey wanna have lunch tomorrow ill pay for everythinglets just hang out and have a good time the answer is stillthanks for asking but my wife has all these errands she wants me to do tomorrow sorry man i pretty much make it irresistible and they still say no im just perplexed im beyond puzzled i dont get it i cant even get a friendship started because it takes two to make that workyou know anyway i dont really know what advice im searching for on here i guess i just wanted to air it out everyone needs friendship its something you crave like food hydration or sleep its a very natural part of life but for some reason its just never been available to me i feel exceedingly alone and unworthy ive even bluntly asked people to tell me the truth but they always spin up some excuse as to why they arent available the timing is off the weather their wife has errands they need to run they arent feeling well maybe next weeketcetc thanks for listening and maybe there is someone out there with a similar story,1

dumb and confused sometimes i get really dumb and it bothers me ill have jumbled thoughts ideas dont move continuously i have adhd but this feels different my normal struggles with focus leave me intelligent i basically lose the ability to do anything that requires thought even if its something ive done many times before during the dumb periods does this make any sense i dont think this has always happened to me so im curious about other peoples experiences i dont think its a medicine thing because ive been on this cocktail for a year and it only happens rarely for reference im on lamictal and lexapro,1

its just another day but my girlfriend might as well be wonderwoman my girlfriend is a nurse and works three twelve hour overnight shifts in a row during the week she lives in seattle while i am in portland we take turns visiting over the weekend at each others homes when i first met her i had switched up my schedule to wake up at 5am to go to the gym and work on my ma before going on with my day i was having difficulty keeping to the regime and when i told her she promised to make sure i got up every day at 5am and to hold me accountable to get these things done every day for the last six weeks that is what she has done whether it be to call me during one of her shifts or setting her alarm to wake up when i would wake up four weeks ago she started sending me a coffee via uber eats or making me one when i finished my gym routine and whatever i needed to do with my ma for the day they say its the small things that matter in relationships not necessarily the big gestures or grand proclamations of love ive found with her its true theres so many other thing little things she does and they speak so much in volume about her i had a stressful meeting with a venture capitalist over the weekend and she wrote on a sticky note you got this putting if on my laptop i only noticed it as i was pulling out my laptop and sitting down for the meeting she just smiled and winked at me before leaving the room i just came back from a booking today to find panda express on my porch from her shes pulling overtime today with extra twelve hour shift and she still found the time to send me some freaking food because i hadnt eaten anything yet today at this point i am astutely and thoroughly blown away by her i am pretty much head over heels in love with her at this point the size of her heart is only outmatched by the size of her brain and my want to keep her laughing at my lame ass puns until she is hoarse,0

stress postcar accident background my actual car is a manual and it got reversed into the other day so driving an automatic hire car last night i was driving with my girlfriend back to her house and i felt a bit sick in the stomach and was just sitting in silence i was in my own world stressing about my car and life in general i was driving at about 8090kmh and for the first time ever i mistakenly thought i was still in my own car and as something went into my eye i went to downshift so i could keep a bit of control and speed whilst i fix my eye and i hit the break with my left foot in the 1 second it took to process everything and think about everything that was going on and as i was going to take my foot off the break the car that was behind me smashed into us and caused a 4 car accident yes it was a very honest mistake it was the first time its ever happened and i thank god no one was seriously hurt the car behind me seemed too close but i just cant help being depressed about the whole situation if i wouldve stopped at a service station earlier or been in a different lane would it still have happened am i the one at fault because i made that small mistake why did it have to happen when my girlfriend was in the car with me just why i feel like everyone has the right to push me down and say im in the wrong and i feel everyone should criticise me and make me feel like the piece of trash i am people keep saying accidents happen and sometimes god puts us through things we dont understand and that theyve done the same thing too when driving an automatic but i cant help but feel like theyre just taking pity on me and dont want me to feel bad when i should tldr was the front car in an accident and i dont think im at fault but cant help but feel like i am just need some help on how to stop stressing and feeling like this,1

losing control of my life rant this is just me ranting but any help will be very much appreciated im a sophomore in highschool taking all honors and ap classes my time management has never been the best but ive managed to go through middle school with basically all as when sophomore year came along i didnt know how to handle all the work plus trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle eventually the semester exams rolled in and that was when it got really bad i wouldnt sleep or eat for days always staying in my room trying to cram in order to get my grades up to all as kept this up for a little more than a month and passed the exams but i was so unimaginably burnt out and had basically no energy left at all we had winter break for a couple weeks and i hoped that thisll help get my energy back for the next semester its been months now and i still dont feel right the way i got my work done before is obviously not the healthiest but at least i got it done now im always thinking about the things i need to finish but never actually doing them worst part is i dont even procrastinate by doing the things i considered fun probably would just lie down and watch youtube or look at memes for hours not really enjoying it but at least i can take my mind off of work for a bit it makes me a little sad to know that the things im learning at school would be things id be interested in but the deadlines and assignments kinda turned potentially fun topics i could be passionate about into just another load of stuff i need to do i never go out and hang out with friends anymore when i do its because i force myself so days just consist of me alternating between finishing work and just mindlessly looking through stuff on reddit me and my family are from a third word country we moved to the us because of my dads job my parents were not well off financially at all growing up they say that if they could endure a life with hardships like that i can deal with a little bit of stress and because of that im always questioning if im just whining and milking this to be a bigger deal than it is or if this is something serious i need to fix it really feels as if im wasting my entire life and that theres no way to pick myself back up again because if i do take time to rest or figure things out for a couple days its as if im be taking time away from schoolwork if you read this far thanks for hearing me out have a nice day,1
every cell in the human body emits a unique frequency and your brain puts out a frequency which can be picked up by other brains it can pass through anything because it basically is the same frequency type that a radio transmitter puts out the frequency that youre transmitting from your brain is smaller but it has a unique characteristic unlike radio frequencies which is that the frequency that your brain transmits can instantaneously travel faster than the speed of light and if transmitted can be picked up the exact same moment by another human brain on the opposite end of the planet energy and frequency are the same everything on planet earth emits a different frequency a frequency is also called a vibration its also called energy it is quantifiable and it is measurable every atom emits a frequency your dna at the lowest level emits a unique frequency so your brain is a receiver and a transmitter a frequency thats the first concept and the second concept is the law of attraction which says whatever frequency you emit that exact same frequency is drawn to you there will be a magnetic pull and this is a scriptural principle for those of you who are christians jewish muslims hindus or buddhists all these books teach very similar concepts what you sow also you reap when you put out a frequency the law of attraction says it must come back law of attraction says by magnetic pull that has to bring that exact same frequency back which is based on whatever vibration you put out whatever frequency that your brain emotions body and electromagnetic field puts out it will attract and it will defy any physical law selfinduced goosebumps from positive stimulis allows you to take 100 control of your transmitter by vibrating different parts of your body and is also able to as a gentle euphoric vibrating wave travels underneath your skin sometimes cold and other times hot vibrate your whole physical body when doing so you consciously activate your physical and spiritual body to attract whatever intention narrative thought and emotions that are present when consciously summoning your selfinduced goosebumps goosebumps is just the physical reaction but underneath it theres a real vibrating wave that can be looked at as energy ive found many names for this energy like spiritual chills euphoria voluntary goosebumps ecstasy prana chi qi vayus aura mana life force pit rapture ruah ether nephesch chills frissons the force and many more if you would like to know how to activate at will fully control your spiritual chills and how its an important ingredient to the law of attraction heres a five minute video explaining just that youtube video,0

ive been staying up until 5am playing video games and then sleeping until 34pm everyday i have no desire to get up earlier and do something with my day even though if i could force myself id probably feel better it starts to get dark within an hour of waking up usually and its so depressing but it keeps me isolated in my comfort zone being up in the middle of the night feels freeing for some reason no one awake no guilt for responsibilities i can sleep away the day and not feel guilty about it but im wasting time and i want more than anything to feel okay again i want to start to get my life back to something that i can derive some genuine enjoyment out of and move forward with productive things i became depressed again about 10 months ago since my mom passed and these past 10 months have gone by so fast im almost 26 and im scared at how fast time is moving without any stability forming in my life tldr im 25 and i feel like im wasting time which i am but its so hard to even attempt to start getting my life in order it feels so far out of reach,1

i have school tomorrow and im so fucking tired i know this sounds like some edgy fake shitmix some fourteen year old has conjured up for the sake of attention but im just so tired ive struggled with my mental health for the past year and a half now my thighs always have some sort of fresh cuts on them i feel like lead and i cant seem to hold onto the small rays of happiness even if i wanted to and school is justso intimidating i told everyone id get up and make lunches for my sister and i because since cooking is something i like i thought taking that initiative would help me get up in the mornings but now the aspect of everything going wrong and being too swamped with work makes my head heart and i feel like my hearts about to burst because even this small thing that couldve been a reprieve from the cold dark and unmotivated pit i was in will just slip from my fingers like everything else i dont know how to be a teenager whos dealing with mental health and being around people who have no idea what it actually is like i know i sound like im putting on some kind of noble woe is me kind of attitude by saying this because im so edgy and quirky and for what for wanting to rip my guts out for saving money for my funeral for not being able to wash myself or keep up basic hygiene because it takes so much fucking effort and im so tired of hearing the adults whove had nothing but success call suicidal people the scum of the earth or my father and mother if i have to call them that screaming at me for yet another flaw i didnt notice existed until they pointed it out or the emo dipshits,1
why do we need to find out who we are and be happy journeying through this life we find ourselves arriving into places that trigger us to become who we really are these places bring experiences thoughts and emotions inside ourselves that become our mirror but unfortunately these experiences often reveal themselves as traumas highlevel stress chronic diseases or powerful shocks that usually make us feel disempowered and weak and most of all they make us feel the victims of this world since childhood we are usually taught that our external environment has the most powerful impact on our lives we are told to be competitive to be smart to win over every time insist as far as possible and earn as much as we can society shows us constraint guilt and limits in all areas it teaches us about the power outside of us which we are taught to own to accumulate as much as possible to keep it and not share it so that we will not lose it in this process of being educated by society we lose ourselves forget who we are and lose all connection to our future and our most desired path we lose connection with our passion and enthusiasm with our true ability to love and we forget about our potential here on earth its like massive amnesia at a planetary level that keeps repeating for ages and millennia and waking up seems so hard deep inside during these painful experiences we start to pine for a better life for an amazing us inside for grandness and happiness and for living from our true inner self but deep inside we all know there is much more to life than having a job working a lot having 23 vacations a year and then succumb at one point after we repeat the same experiences the same thoughts and emotions actually there is no need to find ourselves we do not have to do anything but if we want to live life to the fullest and feel elevated emotions like love true compassion joy and fulfillment we have to decide do we want to live as the persona molded by society outside us or do we want to live as the most honest and powerful self liberated by our own light and power within what is there to lose what is there to win from where i am standing after more than 10 years of searching and questioning everything we never lose anything but we can win the most gracious gift of all the gift of being a creator and the freedom to live a life beyond our wildest dreams,0
toxicity within my club this is affecting my mental health greatly in that i am constantly on the edge i run a club in my university and there is a kid trying to remove me from power by consistently being toxic to me i am the president and he keeps trying to make decisions by himself by pretending to be president and changing the schedule to new members who join it makes me frustrated he is doing good things but only for himself and all he asks are questions within our group chat it makes me scared to even talk because he asks the same questions repeatedly and if you answer he goes on a question rampage trying to demoralize you into thinking you did something wrong when you havent done nothing he does this every single day even on the weekends it has been a bitter experience so i have just muted the group chat and i feel disconnected with the other members as some of them are on his side i can just quit but im pretty sure that is what the kid would want and it pains me greatly that i am even thinking of doing that just because of one kid i cannot just kick him out as that would be a very evil thing to do and would be seen as abuse of power,1
what am i im burnt out ive barely even lived but i kinda tried and just felt uncomfortable every time id be a horrible parent but it doesnt even matter im so uncomfortable around girls it freaks them out i couldnt support a family or even take a gf on dates or even support myself on my salary with no real plan to make it better i lost 120lbs and was still too fat for girls to be attracted to me and get past me social awkwardness idk if its gotten worse or been the same because even in ms and hs my friends wouldnt invite me if they were around girls only problem i really have with being forever alone is not being able to be around my friends theyre all either married or have gfs and only really go out with their partners now and being 7th wheel isnt fun also how do i make new friends theyre all either married or have gfs or go be around girls lol and its the same problem all over get a gf why would a girl date me if i have no friends lol i just want to pay off my bills and disappear so i can finally be in my own world and stop making people uncomfortable,1
i socially isolate myself and then wonder why people dont ask to hang out it seems like all of my close friends have moved on and made better friends a big part of me doesnt blame them they seem happy and for that i am glad its not like they havent reached out before they did and i was guarded and made excuses not to hang out nobody knows how to talk to a friend who is deeply depressed it must be difficult a few weeks ago some of my coworker friends planned a night out for this weekend and invited me i accepted and was looking forward to it but a few days ago my one friend told me it had been moved to a later date due to scheduling conflicts i saw tonight through her instagram story several of them ended up going out anyway as a group it looks like they decided to go without me for whatever reason im not sure who i am if im such a terrible friend not sure how to make it better,1

im done can someone suggest an alternative to suicide i have been trying sooo hard to help myself i have been in depression for the past 3 years i have never gotten an opportunity to talk to anyone about it eventhough i always craved for it nothing in my life works according to what i plan and theres alot which i have gone through in the past couple years no one seems to understand my situation i used to be optimistic eventhough i was depressed i used to think that i could snap out of it by watching motivational videos on youtube follow psychiatric tutorials but nothing works im from a very complicated family and my culture is very demanding and not too depression friendly so i really cant kill myself even if i did i just cant bear the pain those related to me will feel but i need something other than suicide which pretty much gives me peace,1

i feel something is off with me hello friends i dont really know where else to go i dont know whether perhaps one of you kind people may be able to offer some advice for me ive been dealing with i would say a mild level of stress my whole life i grew up with parents with high expectations recently my parents split up and the parent i live with took it extremely bad screaming and crying smashing things from time to time amongst other things even after 2 years they are to some degree still like this only now after 2 years have i started to feel like ive been transported to a parallel universe surely this isnt my life is what goes through my head when the split happened i dont even remember crying or really reacting i remember just listening i feel like the last two years have been a blur i have this on and off urge to just jump out of my skin and be someone else anyone else its as if i am panicking because ive woken up in someone elses body and into the wrong life this is a new feeling for me i am usually one to spend time with myself and understand how i am feeling and acknowledge it but this is as if i am inside someone elses head its like i dont know myself anymore i start questioning things and giving things the benefit of the doubt i hate it i dont want to die but i just want to switch off im so confused i have discussed this with my therapist and they did not provide advice i am happy to provide more info if needed thanks in advance,1
every time i try to speak about my depression it sounds like a cliche so i keep it to myself i have tried to write something in this group so many times but i always delete it ive typed this exact sentence at least 4 times in the past but havent hit send so fuck it im depressed im dealing with it in my own way i listen to music a lot it takes me somewhere i just wish some songs were longer i take codeine to numb myself quite often i get a prescription every now and then as i have a condition which leaves me sore nearly all the time haha lifes a cunt i cant cry i need to i feel it nearly everyday being right on the brink of tears but theres nothing there i dont know how its possible to feel so emotionally empty and numb but at the same time feel everything every fucking thing i cant breathe sometimes because of just how real it becomes so many thoughts running through my head at once every little insignificant detail about the most pointless fucked up things all at once and yet if you were to look at me you would see the most blank dull empty stare im nothing and yet my mind tries to be everything haha such a broken piece of shit i think about hurting myself and dying a lot it used to scare me i remember the first time i genuinely thought about killing myself it scared me and it kinda felt good that thats how i reacted but that was ages ago its so common now its just part of what it is to be me insignificant hey thank you everyone for the response when i typed this out i didnt expect it to get noticed and i almost didnt send it again haha i just thought fuck it what have i got to lose but im glad i did i cant believe how many of you are in exactly the same position as me people who have commented or messaged me personally and said that i hit a personal note to them it means a lot to me im sorry if i dont get around to replying to everyone you know how it is but believe me that i appreciate this more than you know in the future i will try to refrain from deleting my post instead of hitting send much love,1
have no goal in life i have such a privileged background and i am still privileged why is my life still so shit my dad has some degenerative spine crap and is in constant chronic pain he has to take off of work and is on disability for a while whenever i visit home listening to him groan and scream in pain is so heartbreakingly frustrating sometimes he takes his frustration out on us i dont blame him but it still hurts my little brother is constantly trying to kill himself or at the very least trying to hurt himself i let him go out one night not realizing he was trying to kill himself thankfully he was stopped but i feel so stupid and like a failure of an older sister my mother has arthritis and is also in constant pain in her shoulders feet back knee you name it shes also constantly stressed trying to look after my dad and keeping my brother alive my boyfriend broke up with me because of issues with things that are hard to explain our relationship was great except for this one thing that completely destroyed it for him and there is nothing i couldve done or still can do to fix it it hurts so much bc he was so good to me were still in close contact while we reflect on ourselves but i doubt hell ever come back to me i cant open up to anyone my family is too stressed with their own shit i dont really feel comfortable opening up to my friends and i literally cant put my shit on my now ex because thats not who he is in my life anymore i cant afford therapy time or money wise its probably stupid but my whole motivation in life was to finish college and live happily with my ex but now thats gone and now im just aimlessly going through life what am i even doing anymore i dont feel connected with anyone,1
we finally said i love you to each other and it felt so cathartic me and my boyfriend started out as a long distance situation started talking last september he flew to meet me in december and i moved back to the country hes from back in may thats when we started living together he always went the extra mile for me and i tried to do the same for him but until couple weeks ago we never said i love you to each other so couple weeks ago we had a fight nothing crazy not our first one once we resolve things we usually cuddle and just give each other affection helps to let go of all the negative things accordingly after this argument he was holding me then he just squeezed me and told me he loved me i got flustered so i responded with a squeeze back and an aww quickly followed by i love you too my mind was racing he said it so casually and out of nowhere i thought that first i love you must not be of equal importance to him as it is to me and in the moment i assumed that since we were already calling each other my love he probably thought he had already confessed his love for me nevertheless i was happy around a week goes by we go to visit his dad for a couple days it was my first time meeting him so quite a bit of anxiety day 1 goes great lots of good food great conversation and a lot of booze so by the end of the night im in my feelings once we hit the hay i hug my boyfriend and tell him that i love him he squeezes me real tight and for much longer than he usually would so i ask whats up he says well its the first time you said you loved me to skip the most of the following conversation he didnt hear me whisper the i love you too to him when he told me he loved me he was very nervous to say it in the first place and then thought i didnt say it back according to him he was happy to wait until i was ready to say it back since i gave a very positive response but knowing him im 99 sure it was torturous for him to think we were not on the same level im so glad i said it that night i dont find it easy to tell people i love them a bit of an avoidant attachment style going on there yet it felt so good it felt good to just say it and it felt good to be able to tell him that i did say it back that day it felt good to show him that his feelings were reciprocated and appreciated and to tell him that i was waiting for a long time to either say it or hear him say it having had a difficult childhood and adolescence where me displaying vulnerability and emotional pain was greeted by indifference and dismissals nowadays i still find it challenging to be vulnerable despite having worked out most of my other issues i have learned to depend on myself and only myself on pretty much all levels and saying i love you implies that to a certain degree i am willing to depend on and be attached to that person its not my first relationship and not my first time saying i love you but for the first time it doesnt feel like an unhealthy addiction or a rushed decision i waited we waited and im more comfortable in my vulnerability than i have ever been hes more appreciative of my vulnerability than most people ive considered family friends or lovers and im very appreciative of his im happy,0

we only see those who get better aka survivorship bias we hear the stories of the people whose mental illness got better but theres little acknowledgement of those who have only gone downhill im tired of hearing it will get better just look at what happened to me because it hasnt why should i continue suffering for the lofty hope that my depression will ease up i call it as i see it if my mental state has deteriorated even after years of treatment then i probably wont end up as a survivor,1
i dont know what to do anymore i graduated from college in the midst of the pandemic and i havent been able to get a job for the past few months even after applying like a madman and i recently found out the girl ive been talking to has been faking an interest in me to use me as an emotional support outlet i cant see a direction or meaning to my life for now and the fact that im being used sucks even more ive been feeling numb mentally for the past few months and i dont know what to do anymore,1
im kinda disgusted with myself i have a depression nest my bedroom is disgusting i have a path from my door to my bed and thats just about it everywhere else i have piles of clothes and old food containers and boxes and crap i dont need i have a hoarding problem on top of being too depressed to clean my dad is a pack rat too so ive always spent my life in clutter i dont think its at tv show level but its still bad does anyone have tipsadvice for finally cleaning up ive been trying but honestly some days i pick up like 2 pieces of trash and toss a couple things in a laundry basket and i automatically feel drained i remember when my old roommate barged in to my room mistaking im coming for come in i was always so careful about keeping roommates out of my room always locking the door because i was never more embarrassed i saw the shock on her face as i rambled off reasons for the mess i just dumped everything in here when i moved in ive just been super busy with school and work has me exhausted i know she didnt buy it she must have thought i was the nastiest person alive she asked if i wanted help but i declined and said id handle it i never really did i can handle living in clutter its all ive ever really known i do wish i had a super cute and organized room but on the rare occasion i do try to organize everything it never lasts but i feel so guilty guilty because i have a dog hes been my best bud for the last 15 years or so and he doesnt deserve this life like i said weve always lived in a cluttered house but my room is the absolute worse he gets fresh food and water and i try to take him outside often so theres no accidents in here and he gets fresh air but he still does not deserve this i know he walks around my piles of crap just fine and still runs full speed to see me when i walk through the door his tail wagging so fast that his whole little body wiggles i know he loves me and i love him with my entire heart hes one of the only things that keep me going because im afraid of what would happen to him if i were gone i dont think my family would be the best caretakers and i saw how the poor guy grieved when my mom died i saw how he was confused and still went to her bedroom looking for her every single day for the longest time when wed pull up in the car hed race to the passenger door and wait for her to come out my family showed me how he kept finding his way into my room when i first left for college i wouldnt want to leave him hurt and confused like that so i keep pushing on but i cant let him keep living like this im disgusted and deeply disappointed in myself but ill do my best to clean my room and throw some stuff away it definitely will not be anywhere close to easy but i still want to try edit wow i did not expect to get such a huge response i basically passed out on my bed right after posting this but i only expected maybe 1 or 2 people to comment also a big thanks for the awards its been a difficult path ive been trying to clean for the past week or so and it feels like i havent made so much as a dent in the mess but i appreciate the kind words and motivation ill be reading through the comments and try to respond to as many as i possibly can,1
you need therapy therapy is too expensive 60 for an hours session each week how are we supposed to get therapy when its locked behind such prices one session isnt going to do it its an ongoing expense thats just way too difficult to afford i live in the uk and yes i have tried to get it through the nhs they told me to wait for a piece of snail mail before i can book anything i never received it and weeks later they told me they hadnt heard from me so assumed i didnt need them and scratched me off their list as a depressed person that basically really screwed me over and almost broke down so im not going that route again whenever someone learns i have depression they always ask about this and its like they just dont understand im not that fucking rich i struggle to afford anything id have to give up my car for that expense why is this so hard to understand its ridiculously out of reach and this alone aggravates depression we simply will never be happy ever,1
i wish everyone would hate me to an extent i want the people close to me to hate me so i dont feel bad if i decide to kill myself i hate the fact that if i ever decide to go through with it that i would hurt the people i care about most to a really deep degree,1
what the fuck is wrong with me just to start it off i have chronic low back pain for about 2 years and a half now so maybe it contributes to my symptoms of depression the thing is i have so many mixed feelings like yeah sometimes i feel depressed because i cant fully enjoy activites due to the pain but im still here smiling and joking around and trying to have fun sometimes i feel so fucking depressed then the next day im gonna be alright and happy even if im in so much pain i dont know whats wrong i feel like i have a depression and at the same time i dont im not even sad of my situation im just trying to cope with it i feel like i have no feelings whatsoever or i just cant really describe what im feeling its so fucking confusing lol,1

has this happened to you have you ever met a small group of people for me 2 and almost instantly connected like i trust them more then people i have known for over 5 years and its only been 2 weeks there females and im 14m but both of them make me feel so confortable i cant really explain it im a freshman in high school and i look forward to that class every day just to see them i have never felt like this but i kind of feel like i should open up to them because i havent really told anyone to the complete extent how i feel tho i feel like i shouldnt because i dont want to ruin the friendship and then lean on them hard if they do decide to stay,0
suicidal the only thing stopping me from killing myself is that i dont know how to do it painlessly and i dont want my mom to be sad i really wish there was just a button i could press that would make it so i was never born if things stay like this i might finally give up be relieved from everything never have to worry ever again it sounds really nice,1
anyone else get up get dressed and then just sit and stare at the floor or wall for 30 minutes trying to figure out why youre even bothering then the fact that i wasted all that time makes me feel guilty and sad,1
i get it being friends with a depressed person isnt fun you know what else isnt fun having a voice inside of your head all day every day telling you how annoying stupid fat and failed that you are with nobody around you to tell you those voices arent true and on days that i forget to smile not having someone to remind me how to and instead being dropped like a hot potato and ignored not even a you dont seem like yourself today are you okaylook at this memeanything but treating them like an asshole who kicked your dog my only friend is not speaking to me because i was acting sad the other day and didnt have the energy to be my fake bubbly self i have nobody to turn to anymore im not doing too well,1
my little brother is 7 and he already hates himself he called himself stupid so i asked him why do you think youre stupid i call you smart all the time my brother is seven and he said everyone calls me smart but they are lying all i know how to do is play games im dumb hes fucking seven hes fucking seven years old and hes fucking showing signs of depression already my parents are neglectful and they did me the same way the first time i knew i hated myself was around 9 how did they fuck up again fucking how edit sorry for diagnosing him with depression im obviously not qualified to do so i made this post in tears after listening to him because he has the exact same mentality as i did and still do and i am extremely depressed myself so i was pretty much hysterical edit 2 i didnt expect this to garner so much attention thank you to everyone who also understands what im talking about and shared advice or their personal experience im debating on deleting it because people are trying to patronize me and minimize my abuse im used to it but it gets annoying edit 3 i wanna say this tho my father works hard and he tries but hes an enabler my mother is neglectful and abusive and he doesnt do anything about it i do think if my father broke off from my mom he could raise my brother and ive been begging for him to do so because i plan on killing myself,1
only thing i want out of life is death in my sleep everything has become an obligation nothing brings me any joy but going to bed do not care at all about meds or therapy nor will i do anything that might help me out of this either never had a single dream or aspiration all my life i am just simply not meant to exist,1
how do i leave work at work i have an hour long train ride home and i am looking for the best way to unplug and disconnect from thoughts of work so that i can come home destressed and ready for time w my kids i hold a c level position and am continuously thinking of work and the open items looming in the head my current hour is spent blasting music into the headphones playing a video game on the phone and generally glancing at the phone every few seconds none of which brings any relief,1
life is stagnant hello reddit this is a basically a little vent and i apologise if it is in the wrong group i am happy to delete it if needed anyway i am almost 27 but i cant help but feel like im going on 72 this isnt exactly a bad thing but realistically my life feels like it is never going to change in any major or meaningful way ever again i graduated from college and cant afford more education nor i dont have enough money to even save up for a home i do have enough to split the cost of a cozy apartment with my partner which we do and we intend to remain child free however we do have a lovely cat honestly it feels like the only other major thing we could do is get married and even if we did we wouldnt make it some grand ordeal wed probably quite literally just go to city hall together and then maybe go out for a nice lunch and call it a wedding please note that neither of us want it to be a big deal for many reasons and what i described would actually be ideal if we ever did even get married outside of that i dont really even have any talents hobbies passions or interests that i really find interesting enough to pursue further athough im content with that it just adds to the atmosphere of stagnation but what fun is it forcing yourself to get good at something if you have no interest or motivation to do so i also dont have many friends nor do i enjoy being around people or crowds very much but even if i did i dont think the odds of me randomly meeting some dear new friend that will magically change my life forever are very high im used to friends walking away from me after a while actually and only really have one or two friendships that have stood the test of time i guess the last thing worth mentioning is that i love travelling but its really hard to afford that and fit it in plus you cant really go far right now due to the delta variant does anyone else relate to any of this if anyone has any tips tricks or advice of how to break up the monotony id be happy to hear it thank you very much for reading,1

depression made me lose so many years and it ensures ill remain poor and with no skills forever like for example i want to learn programming wanted to for years but i never will why because ive been depressedanhedonic for so long that i cant think of anything i want to build in order for me to learn programming id need to have proper motivation wanting to build something wanting to do something with those skills but ive thought about it for years now i just dont want to build anything i love the idea of building something of having programming skills that i can use to build something but when it comes to it i just dont have any idea what i want to build cause i dont want to make a game for example damn if i could answer this id probably end my depression eventually if only there was something i wanted to build other than this vague idea of wanting to be good at programming and making money off it which is the wrong way to think about it and it wont be a good motivator im already in my late 20s im running out of time already done with university with shitty useless degrees in fields i hate i need to start learning now if im to ever teach myself enough to do anything,1

is there a light at the end of the tunnel ive been battling with chronic stress for about 3 weeks now i want to say the cause of it is my job its the only thing that makes sense due to the pandemic ive had 4 different positions within the past 3 months my regular position that i held before this all this happened was awesome i actually loved my job and looked forward to work each morning when everything shut down back in march until about the middle of may i was moved to two other positions that we still pretty relaxed the hours just kind of sucked but now this new role that ive been in for about a month is killing me its very stressful the days are long it seems like a constant race against the clock the people i deal with can be a pain which adds more stress i keep telling myself its only temporary and hopefully ill be able to get my old job as things start to normalize more but for the past 3 weeks my symptoms have included weighted chest most prominent symptom lightheadednessdizziness tightness in neck and shoulders lower back pain anxiety that wont go away rapid heartbeat acid refluxheartburn stomach issues fatigue i have tired to change my diet to start eating a bit healthier ive also been trying breathing exercises and doing stretching in the evenings when i get home from work it seems to help a little i also plan on getting back to the gym because i know exercise will help out as well im just wondering if this is something that will eventually go away or am i in it for the long haul ive felt this way once before about a month before my daughter was born but it completely went away right after she was born not kidding maybe big life changes are my trigger but i didnt feel this way when i got married or bought a house or anything like that any insight or advice to manage this is greatly appreciated,1

family pressures im a student 25 been studying towards a goal since the day i left highschool but im not where im supposed to be i dont want to make this longer than it needs to be so my basic question is how does everyone deal with family expectations i keep getting asked the same questions when do you finish uni what are you going to do after what does your degree allow you to do i cant go to a single family event without going through this exact line of questioning to the point where i dont want to see them anymore my father whom i live with is the same i know the direction im interested in but i dont yet know the path and i feel like people speak to me like i should like my life should be planned out already i got tired of it and so i lied a dumb decision i know they think ive finished when i really havent because i got tired of them wondering why of feeling like a failure for now being where i should but now keeping up the lie has made things worse now im expected to be progressing and getting a new job etc when im still where i have been for the last 5 years its been 6 months and ive already been accused of having too much time on my hands despite studying full time and working 3 jobs because they dont know how do you get yourself out of a hole that you dug yourself and how do you do it when youre terrified of the consequences of telling the truth maybe im a coward but i feel lost the one person who knew me most and supported me most i lost halfway through this degree and ever since i feel like i havent been able to cope at all,1

physical symptoms hi just wanted to ask if stress can cause many many weird physical symptoms all started when my taste and smell senses decreased a lot for a few weeks took 3 covid tests and all negative during the same time my right arm started to hurt then my right leg and some time later my whole right side of body went numb not like paralized numb but skin feels numb and tight i also have buzzing in my arm and leg and my fingers feel stiff a few days ago my little toe in right leg went numb too like really cant move it and my jaw hurts a lot on the right side that jaw thing has been going of for the last year dentists say nothing is wrong i noticed that i clenched my teeth sometimes so thought that maybe i am just so stressed and this is the outcome but right now i dont clench my teeth but my jaw pain is still back with all these new symptoms anyway i have been to my doctor and neurologist and right now i am waiting for mris neuro wants to eliminate ms when this all first started i didnt feel more stressed or anything but now of course i am stressed i feel kinda fine some days and then the other days like today my arm and leg are in so much pain i think nerve pain my skin feels very sensitive and almost painful to touch too and i just feel so weak and tired and only want to stay in bed and feel like i want to cry so i guess my question is that could all these symptoms be because of stress or anxiety my neuro seems nice but all the other doctors seemed to think and said that maybe you are just stressed of course i dont want to get diagnose like ms from my neuro but at the same time i really would not want to believe that just stress could cause these kind of symptoms have anyone had similar physical symptoms and turned out it was just stress or anxiety could stress really make me be physically in pain or numb like this,1

identity crisis easily influenced more concerned about others hi i never thought i would get to this point but ive been having an identity crisis for what feels like only 2 months but these things dont happen overnight i used to be consumed by my goals my grind growing up it was mostly me and my small circle but now that ive accomplished these things i have fallen into the worst depression of my life because these goals werent rooted in myself just there to prove a point i find myself more concerned with my friends lives comparing myself to what theyre doing and checking my phone to ensure im in constant communication with someone but not actually living my own life im wildly indecisive and influenced for example switched from an in person class to an online class because of fear of a professor and conversations i had with someone forgetting that i only wanted to be in school if it was in person i use social media as a way to self harm watching others live the lives i want to i know more about what my ex and their friend group is doing then how to solve my problems i just feel so consumed by others and i dont know how to turn it off i feel as though i dont have interests anymore only consuming whats recommended i used to have pockets of the internet of the world that felt like mine but i dont anymore i am severely insecure happy for my friends on the outside jealous on the inside i am too old for this i dont know where to start its both my goals and aspirations i need to improve but also myself and simply waking up in the morning eating cooking for myself organizing and taking care of myself i have a new therapist and have been doing a dialectical workbook but i still just feel so ashamed and disappointed in myself and i dont know how to get out of it i cant really focus and my memory is fried i have a lot of support but that means nothing when on the inside you feel so lost behind and disconnected has anyone experienced this i know its one day at a time but i need hope i also am running out of money which is a stressor and my health insurance barely covers anything idk what to do,1

advice for employee who needs to find problems and manage dozens of small tasks hi all hopefully these kinds of questions are welcome one of the members in my team is an engineer who builds and tests new products it is normal for him to find dozens of problems many of which require negotiation with designers customers and qa folks to resolve he tends to be stressed out by the long list of tasks because they all require stakeholder input and the timing can be out of his control it clearly affects him some days so we talk and i try to understand what can be done to reduce the pressure its not an excessive work load situation the pressure to complete is largely self imposed we are not an organization that blames people nor has this employee ever experienced consequences for missing an problem or timeline he just seems to get hung up when there are lots of little followups nagging at him ive encouraged him to be mindful of the stress and try to reprogram himself to have a more positive outlook of each problem that comes up after all we view this role as somewhat of a savior organizationally why dread the inevitable design bugs are part of the process just today he was in my office venting about how manly people he was waiting on for input and i encouraged him to make lists of open items each morning rather than carry them around for the day in him head this is something i do as a manager to keep from feeling stressed but he was skeptical are there other techniques that i might suggest to help keep the pressure of lots of little tasks from overwhelming him,1
the reality of depression yesterday i was googling most effective suicide methods today i feel fine this has probably happened hundreds of times in my lifetime im 50 now so obviously i havent succumbed to depression yet but the peaks and valleys are insane i guess im insane yesterday it fully made sense to me if i had had immediate means to end my life i could see taking that action this is why i can never have a gun or live in a tall building so far that small voice in me that says it will get better just wait has remained more powerful than the other larger louder voice that says youve always been alone youll always be alone life isnt worth the pain my reality is having both of those voices in my brain and feeling that both are absolutely real when theyre there,1
people who are depressed should reach out to their friends tries to reach out nobody replies update so i thought it would only be fair to post this update while one friend still doesnt seem to give a fuck im meeting another friend for lunch tomorrow turns out shes been having a thyroid flare up one other friend also wants to make lunch plans soon so well see about that some people care but have stuff going on other people dont care pay more attention to the former original post seriously fuck everyone its so easy to say after someone ends their life that they should have reached out to a friend and talked but whos really willing to listen only a select few of us are blessed with friends who listen with sympathy and respond in a timely way the rest of them are just faffers capitalism has rotten human relationships to the core and everything has become disposable including friendships hang on with dear life to those who really care about you and are willing to talk more often than not its people who have struggled with mental illness themselves edit it is usually better to talk to a therapist if you can afford therapy that is about issues that friends do not have the professional training to deal with i dont recommend burdening other people with all your issues because that would just drive them away people have enough shit in their own lives to deal with however it sucks if you want to talk with a friend who clearly knows youre going through a tough time and they dont return your call edit 2 looking back at my post i realise i sound a little angry and cynical but i really wish for a culture where mentally ill people could get the nurturing and support they need a big part of that is also having access to mental health professionals who are capable and helpful if you can please seek the help of a therapist it has helped me realize where my boundaries with others lie and how i can strengthen my own self to ask of others what i needdeserve from them it can be a longdrawn process and you might not always land a good therapist at the first attempt but please persevere if you have the means thanks to everyone for your comments im trying to reply to each one but its hard to keep up so im sorry if i miss yours rememberyoure worth the effort and the struggle so please hang in there edit 3 if youre in the us uk canada or aus you can use this directory to find a therapist near you read about them what insurance they take etc,1

need some advice helping a friend with bpd and more hey i am using a throwaway account as i feel thats the only way i can talk safely about this i am a 28 year old male from europe english is not my first language so sorry if some of the sentences dont make perfect sense i have a female friend for 6 years she is in her early 20s very attractive and very smart person she is the only person that i have considered a real friend for an extremely long time and very important to me we have spoken multiple times about dating but we feel like we love eachother but just met at the wrong time multiple times because there were multiple times initially i got to meet this girl 6 years ago as she was boyfriend of a mutual friend of ours we were drinking out and she drank way too much her boyfriend didnt care too much for her so i took care of her and she later said thats her best memory of me i made her feel safe we talked a lot however we got into an argument when they broke up we ended up not talking for 2 years we are both great on ghosting sadly we ended up talking again 2 years later after i messaged her we became friends again quickly and talked a lot mostly online though as i moved away from the city she lives in i admitted that i loved her and she said she cares for me a lot however she is together with someone she sadly ghosted me again because she felt like couldnt talk to me with her having a boyfriend we ended up talking again 1 year ago in november i once again became friends with her real quick but this time it was different she was about to break up with the boyfriend she ghosted me for she needed a lot of support going through this and i helped her all the way she also ghosted her best friend that she grew up with so i essentially became her best friend we hanged out a lot i told her that i would be moving back to the city once i finished university in summer we talked once again about dating and she said she needs time which i totally understood in january we talked a lot about meeting up which was extremely though as covid was peaking really hard at the time sadly in febuary we part ways i feel like it was my fault this time that she wanted to leave me i always knew she was mentally not all right and im sure i have some mental issues as well multiple males in my family are bipolar i have been depressed every since my last romantic relationship at first i didnt even want to love her because i just felt scared that i would suffer but i couldnt stop loving her since then i researched a lot about bdp and i feel like if i done that sooner i would have recognized all the red flags and didnt drive her away she forgave me in march and said we could try again however sadly we ended up not talking until this weekend we were both baiting eachother to message eachother through various ways but it was beyond obvious both of us wanted to talk one and other i dont think i was ready what was about to come she messaged me on friday very drunk she said she loved my new hair but she also said that she shouldnt have messaged me because this will cause only pain for both of us she said she is doing has been doing horrible she was on a holiday into a neighboring country and she got drugged and raped one night i felt shocked she was already feeling terrible before she way always somewhat suicidal attempted it multiple times when we werent talking she said she is planning to do it again soon i offered to help multiple times but she said she didnt want to mix her online groups with her irl friends anymore as it caused her too much pain already she said she only messaged me because she missed the attention i gave her but she would have never done it if she was sober i tried to message her next day but sadly she wasnt willing to share anything anymore she rejected any of my help and stopped answering the next day i dont know how i can help this person i started reading case studies about her situation the same i read about bdp she said she is beyond saving but i know she is a strong person that just had a lot unfortunate events in her life she really doesnt deserve any of this i want to check up on her in a few weeks but i am afraid that i would just make her block me or push her further away her birthday is also coming up that i got awesome gifts for but i feel like that is a bit scary topic aswell in june before her vacation i got her a beautiful prepared butterfly in a wooden shell its really a beautiful piece of art and i know she was obsessed by butterflies however i am scared it would remind her what happened to her she suggested me a book back in winter called the butterfly garden by dot hutchinson the story in one sentence basically is about a serialkidnapper and killer family that kidnaps 16 year old girls tattoos butterflies on their back rape them and live with them until they are 21 and then they are killed and prepared like butterflies in glass shells im scared that this gift would only make her feel worse but i have some other amazing gifts lined up the issue is im unsure of her address im unsure about housenumber and im sure she wouldnt feel safe me either going to her house delievering it to either im also just have no idea how to approach her now how much time should i give before trying to contact her i know i would wait forever for her and support her all the way but i just feel lost now sorry for huge wot and im sure half of the sentences make no sense but some help would be greatly appreciated,1
my first step to recovering from being an underhappy overachiever like at least some of your here i struggled with a lack of fulfillment and stress due to being a chronic overachiever it took some pretty extreme turning points for me to realize that so many of my ideas about success were not based on my values or priorities but on expectations ideas and opinions that i had internalized and made my own it took me a while to start meditating on the right questions to realize a personal recipe of success that looks very different than the path i took before but that has brought me way more joy and fulfillment i boiled my mistakes and learnings into the following and welcome thoughts from others struggling with overachievement on this thread,0

subconscious anxiety manifesting physically need help recently i found myself having a sensation of tightness in my chest and throat globus sensation its been around for about 2 weeks now no its not covid and its super uncomfortable the only relief i get is sleep i dont have as many anxious thoughts like i used to but i am under a lot of stress with work there is nothing i actively dislike about my job its just that theres a lot to do at the moment and it probably wont let up for another few weeks id happily work through it except i cant go one minute without feeling like i need to inhale very deeply because of this horrible sensation in my throat and chest i was on 10 mg of citalopram until recently which helped me out of a really bad patch and ive upped to 20 mg on the advice of my gp waiting for it to kick in i have also been taking 100 mg of ltheanine twice a day in the morning and at night i take 600mg of ksm66 ashwaganda at night too i also have tried diazepam on occasion im wary of its addictive properties so i dont take it regularly and am not comfortable with taking more than 4mg in a day but this sensation is not going away beta blockers make me incredibly tired ill happily try it on a weekend but for work days its not going to be great does anyone know any way that i can get some relief from this i dont exactly know what im anxious about so i cant actually change my thought patterns the work stress is probably one of the causes but theres nothing i can do about it at this moment and i just wish that it didnt manifest itself in this horrible physical way backstory i definitely have issues with anxiety and have done for pretty much my whole life had a really bad period between april and june but through counselling and changing my medication my thought patterns have definitely got on better i also changed jobs which has been a massive help,1

i dont wanna do this anymore im not a big reddit poster but what i have to say id like at least a select people to hear it idk if i can help anybody but if it helps you to know people are going through the same thing ill tell you im going through it im a 26 yo male and used to be the happiest man without a problem in the world it all started when i was about 1617 years old i had chronic pain and severe kidney problems i went to multiple doctors searching for a cure or a procedure that would return me to normal none of the doctors i visited seemed very interested in fixing my issue as they did in just prescribing me narcotics i was pretty straight laced and at first wasnt even interested at all in taking these medications i just wanted my problems fixed however the doctors insisted and quite literally talked me into taking these medications that controlled me with script after script coming for the better part or 4 years here i sit now after 8 surgeries and probably close to 100 prescriptions for oxycodone vicodin dilaudid and yes even fentanyl wishing i would have just dealt with the pain and never given in to taking the narcotics even once addiction is such a real thing and it can happen to anyone i hate to say im not at fault for this because im sure some of the blame is on me but this cycle of addiction depression and suicidal thoughts and actions would likely not be there if it wasnt for me being given script after script and forcefed pills since i was a teenager now i buy drugs from the streets just to feel anything and i just wish more than anything that one day i can put this neverending cycle behind me im sorry for the rant guys and thank you to anyone that takes the time to read this for reference this was in the us during probably 20122017 when so many doctors were getting in trouble with the law for over prescribing opioid medications we hear all over the news about what happens to these doctors and pharmacists but what about the likely hundreds of thousands of lives that were impacted by them getting patients hooked on pain killers forcing them to either go through constant depression pain and withdrawal symptoms which sometimes feel worse than death itself or going out and finding these drugs elsewhere and buying them for their own use this is what led to such a major opiate epidemic in the states and why so many have lost their lives to this painful and seemingly impossible to escape cycle again sorry for the rant i love you guys redheart,1

i feel like i have no friends theres a long backstory to part of my feelings around this topic but the basics are that i have a twin and weve always shared everything including friends nearing the end of high school they got really annoyed with this and told me all our friends werent mine because they were friends with them first so i essentially cut off a good five or ten people then i had my one friend who was mine and only mine she got a boyfriend near the end of high school as well though we were still close but i rarely saw her then they broke up two years ago and weve been super close for the past two years until recently she got a new boyfriend and i hardly see her or talk to her anymore my sister who ive always been close with has a long term boyfriend too and im considered the third wheel to their relationship so i dont hang out with them much either one of my friends from high school who i cut off recently got back in touch with me and weve been getting close again but about a month ago she got a new boyfriend and i havent talked to her since another of my friends just moved a 20 hour drive away for school another one just moved to a new continent for a study abroad program for a year i thought my mental health was getting better but with all of this happening i feel like im back to being thirteen years old and not wanting to get out of bed at all,1

oh man being chronicly stressed ive become accustomed to stress that i often dont notice what im doing im tired from this overthinking so i may not make sense sometimes,1
hate the idea of doing any work am i only one that feels this way along with all the symptoms of depression the one that i find the least common is the lack of willingness and ability to do anything i hate it when i know i have uni work i hate it when i have to do with the family somewhere i hate it when i have to iron clothes i cant study i can never do my laundry in time etc its not coming from a standpoint of oh i preferrr not to do workkkk today just work in general is painful to me it can ruin my day just hearing that i have any task to complete many depressed people are still having fun going to work doing chores etc but it feels like death to me,1
done trying im done trying to get help i dont have the energy or motivation anymore my mom has said it over and over again if you want help you need to help yourself first i dont have the heart to tell her that im done trying im not gonna kill myself because im too scared,1
i ruined my own life by being an overwhelmingly anxious idiot cant go into details too much for privacy sake but im really falling apart my relationship my friendships my happiness all gone all because i acted upon my own anxieties and panicked i wish i had listened to what people told me to do maybe my life wouldnt be all broken i want to cry everyday i want to die everyday everyday is a battle between wanting to be a better man for myself and those around me and wanting to die i dont know how much longer i can take this but i hope im still here for my daughters sake edit this is wild didnt think this would get a lot of attention i posted this as a means of putting it out there instead of bottling it in and im glad a lot of people resonated with this everything sucks but my daughter is the only thing thats keeping me going i hope everyone has that one thing that motivates them to keep going much love,1
am i suffering from stress or anxiety hello let me start off by saying i am a fairly healthy individual im 18 years old m not overweight and i have no unhealthy habits such as smoking or drinking im not sure if im suffering from stress or if i have a condition randomly throughout the day i get chest aches arm aches leg aches and sometimes headaches i will sometimes feel a little fatigue and dizziness i overthink scary stuff like if im going to die because all these symptoms make me feel like im having heart problems or something serious i get nervous and sweaty when i think about it when i feel the left side of my chest nipple area its really sore and painful same with my left side sometimes my heart will randomly hurt or at least i think its my heart i have like this almost burning sensation on my esophagus or upper chest it doesnt really hurt its just uncomfortable like when you eat a crap ton of really cold ice cream i searched online and apparantly im suffering from stress because i have almost all the symptoms ive been having anxiety for months now so i think i am indeed suffering from stress not too sure tho i realize when i wake up in the morning everything is gone all the pain and anxiety and i feel normal as the day goes by it gets worse and at night its at its worst i just need to know if i should get a checkup for maybe some condition or is it just stress,1

i hate when you feel slightly okay for a brief moment and your mind tells you that you must actually be a fraud and theres nothing wrong with you ive been clinically depressed for nearly 2 years now i never enjoy anything and never look forward to anything but im going to see foo fighters tonight and i feel not too bad at this moment i would nearly say im excited so naturally i start to think that im a fraud and theres nothing wrong with me if i am in fact capable of some sort of positive emotion i fucking love depression smh,1
scary thing that i dont even notice that im stressed anymore last year my family traveled and i was taking a shower then i felt so serene i felt everything around me every second and honestly i cried from happiness i still live with them and quarantine gives no break im not blaming anyone its work and practice nothing stays forever,1

im out of my comfort zone grateful for good stress day 123 this is part of my 365 days of gratitude to work through my depression and the spiral into suicide attempts over the last two years good stress and moving through depression im four days into this new job and im way out of my comfort zone today i am grateful for good stress having not worked for a while i find myself leading a team of very talented software developers theres a lot of processes and systems and new technology that i have to learn in a relatively quick period thats creating a fair degree of stress but today im grateful to have this challenging job where i get to learn some great technology and work with some awesome people what are you grateful for,1
i feel like im getting dumber and dumber everyday i dont know if theres something physically wrong with me or if its just stress related but for about 2 years now i feel as if my cognitive abilities have been worsening i can barely hold a conversation anymore when i do talk i stutterstammermispronounce words my mind blanks out a lot and my attention span is nonexistent i used to be a really smart kid performed very well on the sat despite having awful grades due to feeling indifferent about school then after high school i became a full blown hypochondriac along with having generalizedsocial anxiety as well 2 years ago i felt like i was the man and today i feel like an incompetent moron who becomes less functional each day i think im recovering from my anxiety disorders but i sometimes wonder if im actually just normalizing them causing the illusion of recovery i dont know where to go ive really been trying to get better but i feel like i go two steps forward and three steps back can anyone else relate to this currently typing this out standing in the shower feeling pretty down right now edit ironically enough i forgot to mention that my memory is complete shit now my long term memory isnt bad but holy shit ill forget what you said in a conversation 10 seconds after its said,1
im so fucking sick of being alive i resent my family for being the reason i cant kill myself they have no idea that ive been depressed basically my entire life they think im just lowenergy and have a weird appetite and no desire to be sociable because thats just who i am like its not fucking normal how much of a recluse i am and how i literally never have energy to do shit but nobody bats a fucking eye and for these people im enduring being alive for these people who dont even see me im holding back and suffering through this condition called life people say suicide is selfish i say its selfish to expect me to stick around for this nothing i could look forward to in life is worth this shit i just stay because the only thing worse than being alive is what my death would do to my family sometimes the only thing that brings me peace is pretending that i have the option to kill myself and fantasizing about it,1
the only reason i survive my days is music all day i have my headphones on i even sleep with them because sleeping otherwise is impossible my family hates that i do this and everyday i can hear them complain about my disinterest in everything cant even blame them nobody likes people who are basically broken pieces glued together by a pair of headphones and a sound,1

highfunctioning depression i feel like im living a double life i read a lot of posts on here of people struggling with daily debilitating depression that plagues every aspect of their lives making it difficult to do small things like even take a shower i feel that i am on the opposite side of the spectrum and wanted to share that it is equally as horrible from an outsiders perspective i appear to be a very happy and stable individual i have a financially secure job and i go to work every day and not only try my best but actively try to get along with others and make people laugh every day my coworkers like me and some look up to me no one would think i have any problems at all however i feel like i am hidden behind a veil and when i come home from work and when i am in the privacy of my home i am in such crippling depression i have such terrible episodes of sadness i hate myself i overanalyze everything stupid i do or say throughout the day and i replay it in my mind constantly and belittle myself i dont feel proud of myself for any of my accomplishments and genuinely dont know why anyone even likes me and yet i still get up every day live this routine and put on a facade like i am okay it feels like i am living a double life that i cannot escape,1
7 billion lives whats 1 more i am on the edge of committing suicide and i have a few hours remaining to decide whether i end my life,1
